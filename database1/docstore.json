I was in a long distance relationship with a female for a year already but had never met her. She has a huge problem with germs and ofcourse people getting tested for std\u2019s. She was stern about this. I had led a very unhealthy sexual lifestyle as a young man. I was now 30 but I was afraid of my past, especially my teenage years. Still, I was sure I didn t have anything because I never had any symptoms. Anyways, I got tested for all STD\u2019s right before I went to visit her but didn t get the results until I was already at her place and we had already done multiple sexual acts including intercourse. They called me and told me that I had HSV 2 on my genitals. I was floored. I was sure that someone in my recent past had knowingly given it to me. I was on suicide watch in my own mind. I was so depressed and I knew that it wasn t HIV but I also felt that it wasn t far behind. Infact, I was scared to death when I got the call and heard the doctor say the H and the V. All I thought about was them calling me to tell me that I had HIV but luckily it was only HSV but it didn t matter to me. I felt basically the same way as if they told me it was the other. I felt alone with no one to talk to. I tried to talk to the doctors & nurses on the phone at the health department but didn t feel a lot of sympathy. It was the same when I went to the pharmacy to pickup the meds. I just felt like no one cared and I was a scar on the world. Again, I was so angry at the recent partners I had before my current gf. However, after doing some research and looking at pics, I realized that I had HSV 2 for over a decade, dating back to when I was a teen that had unprotected sex with just about any female I met. It never crossed my mind that they bumps I would get once or twice a year on my penis was herpes or any std. I just always felt that my penis was rubbing against my boxers wrong or the zipper on my pants that caused a rash and it would go away in less than a week. It never dawned on me that It may have been something else but sure enough it was the virus. That gave me mixed feelings. One is that I wondered about all the people I may have infected in the past and 2 is that I felt some relief in knowing that this isn t new, that Ive had it for over a decade, but it never really affected my life in any way. I knew then that I could atleast live a normal life with it. I went on my meds. Acyclovier 2 capsules, 2 times per day. I told the Health department about all my past partners although I was scared. I knew I would want someone to do that for me. However, the problem was my current gf. She\u2019s pretty 50/50 in that on one hand she\u2019s the sweetest person you would ever meet. She has helped me so much and saved my life in so many ways. On the other hand she had a hard upbringing which makes her pretty cold & judgmental at times. I feared telling her for multiple reasons and couldn t bring myself to do it. I kept a close eye on her since she\u2019s been open with me and would tell me if she ever had any kind of discomfort. She never seemed to get any symptoms.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4269, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07587efc-662c-42cd-9973-854fdf4f8f4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "07587efc-662c-42cd-9973-854fdf4f8f4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d283ee6-6f75-4aa1-8939-eb926468e621", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "095290b9e4cab35a1eea2a6a0ece5ad4c903c7ad39091b4560115e1aacb5f588", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50795890-6f57-4719-a584-8c8aad95f20d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b9f5b1bb33bc03dc12f779d19d2bbbe27263520eac043d83f996ad6cac2ef2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I knew then that I could atleast live a normal life with it.

I kept a close eye on her since she\u2019s been open with me and would tell me if she ever had any kind of discomfort. She never seemed to get any symptoms. Meanwhile, Im taking my meds every single day faithfully. Combine that with already having it for 10 years, I was told that my disease was probably pretty dormant and chances of my effecting someone from now on were very low even with unprotected sex. Sure enough 3 more years have gone by. She\u2019s had no symptoms, we see eachother a lot now and she became pregnant after being told she probably would never be able to have kids. I thought I couldn t either because of all the things I did when I was younger. I had so much unprotected sex and never pulled out and I never got anyone pregnant but somehow we found out and it seemed like a blessing. However, one huge problem came up. The doctor who put me on my meds told me I wold have to be on them for life but every January 1st, my prescription is stopped and I have to go see the doctor. I never wanted to do this and she had already said it was a life long thing anyways so she would always just give me a new prescription for the year without even seeing me. Again, its been 3 years since my diagnosis and I literally hadn t had one outbreak. Not even anything close. Then this past new year came and again my meds are stopped. I call to get them refilled but this time they tell me that the doctor is no longer with them and they have a new guy now who I must see before he refills them. I give in and go to see him. He says him and the previous doctor use to argue about the meds a lot because he feels that research has shown that you don t need to take meds every day the rest of your life. That just wait until you feel an outbreak coming on and then take some for a week. I told him that Im truly not comfortable with that. That Ive heard others that do it but it doesn t seem safe to me and I am use to taking this every day. He said I don t need it and I may never have one again after having HSV 2 for almost 15 years and being on meds nonstop for 3 years. He gives me some pills from the office if I ever need for an emergency and he writes me a new prescription just incase of the future but tells me to not take meds everyday. I give in. I was so scared and felt so weird but he was right as nothing happened. I went to see my girl again for the 1st time since I found out she was pregnant. She was now going on 6 months. It is June and I also have been off my meds for 6 months. Everything is lovely until one day I feel a tingle on my penis and here it comes. Everything happened so quick. I was out of state and forgot the meds at home. I was only suppose to be there 10 days and then go back home for a summer semester of school until I come back down in her 8th month where I will live with her permanently. The meds are home and its the weekend. Im not even sure if this is an outbreak since I hadn t had one in so long but I think it could be. It was usually a big area of sores but this time it was just like one or 2 sores. My girl wanted to have sex. I panicked so much. Even though we were always unprotected, I kept condoms on me just incase. Everything was happening so quick and I was scared to say NO and have her ask why. Then what would I say? I told her I wasn t feeling good but she wouldn t stop. I was so scared. I put a condom in my pocket with her not knowing but she grabbed me, pulled me close to her, and started performing oral sex on me.

I put a condom in my pocket with her not knowing but she grabbed me, pulled me close to her, and started performing oral sex on me. I didn t think she would do that. It threw me completely off. Everything was a mess. 1st off it hurt because of my sore, 2nd all I could do was think about me having an outbreak, 3rd I knew that I had read that chances are very very very very low of giving her HSV 2 from her performing oral sex on me. Normally I wouldn t ejaculate but this time I forced myself to just so we didn t have to have sex. Still, later she wanted some and I put a condom on without her knowing and had sex with her. Literally, the very next day she showed my a rash on the back of her hand that was itching and it looked exactly like the herpes blisters that I get on my penis except smaller. I was so confused but at the same time knew where it came from. We also had sex the previous 2 days unprotected but I didn t have open sores. It made me wonder a lot of things. I was always told that Herpes took atleast 2 days to show up so how can she get the signs just 12 hours later. Then I read that in some rare cases they do showup the next day. Then I wondered did I maybe give it to her the other previous 2 days? Was I shedding before I had sores and didn t know it? I was wondering how did she get it when I had a condom on? Is it because she grabbed my penis and went down on me? Everything I read said it was very low risk for that. Then I thought maybe I had rubbed my penis on her vagina or close enough to it. Maybe I touched my infection and put my hand between her legs but I couldn t remember. I thought maybe after intercourse, I took the condom off too soon to hide it from her and maybe some fluids got crossed over. I just didn t know. I was so upset. I hated my doctor for telling me to go off my meds. Even moreso I hated myself for not being man enough to tell her that I was having an outbreak. Why let her go down or me or have sex? I should ve thought of something quick? Im a lowlife piece of crap. That s how I felt. It just all happened so fast that I froze. What about her? What about my baby? How could I let this happen? Why did I stop taking my meds? Why didn t I leave on time? Oh yes, I got off track earlier in my story but I meant to say that I was only suppose to be there 10 days but I changed my flight and had it pushed back another week. Literally the very next day after I was suppose to go back is when I had an outbreak. I only stayed for her and it backfired because I gave her herpes but maybe I gave it to her a couple of days before that anyways? All of this was running through my head. I still didn t have the guts to tell her. I went and got more meds the next day. I was still having sex with her. Each time with a condom that she didnt know about. I pushed my flight back 2 more times and have been here for another 3 weeks. I was kinda happy for a sec because her hand bumps went away pretty quick but then it came right back again. At the same time she said she feels like she\u2019s about to get a pimple on her lip. She said she can feel it coming. She told me to look and you can see it getting red. Sure enough it was but it never came. It went right away like her hand and never returned. Her hand came back though then it went away pretty quick again.

I started to freakout. l I think my girl has a weak immune system and she\u2019s not a fighter when it comes to things that itch. She cant help but to scratch it so I knew it would be hard to heal. I did a ton of research and had all these questions. I read that I cant give her hsv 1 if I only have hsv 2 so Im positive that s what she has. However, I wondered was it only on her hand & wrist but not her vagina since she had no symptoms there and I wore a condom? Everything I read said different things. I wondered could it be Herpetic Whitlow but those things seem like on the finger tips while her\u2019s is on the back of her hand and on the wrist. I read about zolster but she\u2019s already had chicken pox. I read that if its above the waist then its oral HSV 2. Then I read that its the genital one but it has spread. I was going crazy. I was hoping that maybe she got it somehow only on her hand/wrist and nowhere else. That its not on her genitals. I was trying to tell her that she needs to stop scratching and it seems contagious. I told her that its spreading but she kept scratching and had no relief. We were going to have sex again, she put her hand between her legs and I got upset at her and told her not do to that right now. I wasn t mean at all but more concerned and she said that she\u2019s fine, its just a lil rash but it got worse. I read that you cant spread herpes to other parts after the initial infection but this is her 1st one so I was trying to get her to stop before she does it more & more. Yesterday she told me she has some bumps on the bottom of her belly and it looked a little like it but wasn t sure. Im just so scared. I hinted to her a few days ago that it maybe herpes but you can tell she didn t buy that. We tried Benadryl spray, alcohol, and others to stop the itching but nothing worked. She\u2019s been showing her family the rash which was driving me crazy. I even got crazy enough to where the last couple of nights I put some of my acyclovir on ice cream or a donut and gave it to her without her knowing. After she started scratching so bad last night I finally confessed everything to her and she\u2019s been an emotional wreck. We use to not get along a lot anyways because she has a bad attitude at times while Im a pretty laid back dude. Her mother is very all knowing and overprotective so we don t get along all the time either. I just knew everything was going to come to a head. My girl has gone back & forth from crying uncontrollably to then being violent and attacking me. She said I ruined her life. She said she would ve never been with me if she had known. She never talks about what happened a couple of weeks ago with the sores and me letting her go down on me. Instead she focuses about me knowing for 3 years and never telling her. She said she would ve never done that to me. She said no one is going to want her and she doesn t want to be with me again. She then breaks down thinking about our baby.

She never talks about what happened a couple of weeks ago with the sores and me letting her go down on me. Instead she focuses about me knowing for 3 years and never telling her.

She said that the baby is probably going to have it and even if she doesn t at birth, that she wont be able to touch her because she will be so scared of infecting her with her hand & wrist like that. She is so distraught. One time she says she doesn t even want the baby anymore but then she changes. She also got mad at me for giving her the meds since she might cant even take them when pregnant. Then she read about the 1st outbreak stuff late in pregnancy and she is going crazy. I told her that everything she is saying is right. I feel like Im the worst person on earth. I take full blame. I do at times get so upset at that doctor for taking me off the meds but I say that if I didn t let her go down on me that night or would ve just not had sex when I saw the sore then the doctor still may have been right and I wouldn t have passed it on so its all my fault but maybe I was shedding before then and gave it to her anyways. She still brings up the 3 years thing but I told her that I didn t find out until after we had already had intercourse and by that time I felt like you either already would have it or Im on the meds now so she wouldn t get it. She had test she thinks for herpes when she got pregnant and came back negative. I was so happy at that time and thanked god because it had bothered me for years but now I went and screwed it up right after that anyways at the worst possible time. Right when she\u2019s pregnant. I feel so bad. I wish I could have it all back. The 3 years. The 3 weeks. People are so scared to say anything but then they end up having to say something anyways when its 10x worse because you have now infected them which is the one thing you wanted to avoid and could ve avoided if you would ve told them sooner. If she had known then it would ve been her decision. That s what she keeps telling me. I decided her life for her and its not fair. She is so right and everything she feels now is how I felt when I got diagnosed. I told her I already went through that but its not a death sentence and it really doesn t change anything in your life but you can tell that she doesn t want to hear that from me of all people. Im the one guy she doesn t want to hear it from. I don t think we will get through this. I will never forgive myself. Im a great person and Im of age now at 34 yet I managed to do something so selfish, so immature, and so repugnant to someone who loves me so much. Can someone please help me atleast by answering some of the following questions: 1-Did I definitely give her hsv 2 and nothing else? 2-Is it possible that she only has it on her hand/wrist and not her genitals or does it still mean that it definitely started In the genitals? 3-is it possible that its oral hsv2 and not genital? 4-if its went away and came back multiple times in a short span, does that mean its still the 1st outbreak or are these already reoccurring? I just want to make sure that its done spreading so her antibodies can build up and she has no risk of getting it anywhere else, especially the genitals 5-Is all herpes dangerous for your baby during pregnancy or is it strictly if you are having a vaginal outbreak at the time of birth? I keep hearing mixed things on this? Like is my baby still at risk if its only on her hands/wrist and or oral? 6-if it doesn t spread anymore during this outbreak and its not on her vagina, does that mean it will be impossible for her to get it on her vagina in the future since she will have built up the antibodies? 7-Ive heard some say that when you have hsv2 in areas like your hand that its less likely to reoccur or atleast reoccur often while others have said that it will happen more often than the normal kind.

Patients rarely are able to make their own diagnosis of a blood clot so the health-care professional will need to ask questions about what might be happening. If a blood clot or thrombus is a consideration, the history may expand to access the patient's risk factors or situations that might have put the patient at risk for forming a clot.Venous blood clots (venous thrombi) often develop slowly with gradual swelling, pain, and discoloration of the involved area, and the signs and symptoms will progress over hours.An arterial thrombus occurs as an acute event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply as a result of an arterial clot creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.Physical examination will help add information to increase the suspicion for a blood clot.Vital signs are an important first step of the physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (what percent of red blood cells have oxygen attached to them) may provide a clue as to whether the patient is stable or in potential danger.Venous thrombi may cause swelling of an extremity. It may be red, warm, and tender and sometimes the physical exam may make it difficult to distinguish a venous thrombus from cellulitis or an infection of the extremity. If there is concern about a pulmonary embolus, the examiner may listen to the heart and lungs looking for abnormal sounds caused by an area of inflamed lung tissue, or unusual heart sounds.Arterial thrombus is much more dramatic. If an arm or leg is involved, the tissue may be white because of the lack of blood supply. As well, it may be cool to touch, and there may be loss of sensation and movement.

The patient may be writhing in pain, but may not be able to move affected limb. Arterial thrombus is also the cause of heart attack, stroke, and ischemic bowel.Testing for venous blood clotsTesting will depend on the suspected location of the blood clot.Ultrasound: Venous blood clots may be detected in a variety of ways, although ultrasound is now most commonly used. Occasionally, the patient's size and shape may make it difficult for the ultrasound technician and radiologist to evaluate the deep veins of an arm or leg.Venography: Venography may be another alternative to look for a clot. A radiologist injects contrast dye into a small vein in the hand or foot, and using fluoroscopy (video X-ray) watches the dye fill the veins in the extremity as it travels back to the heart. This test is no longer commonly used, but may be available in certain select circumstances.Blood tests: Sometimes, a blood test is used to screen for blood clots. D-dimer is a breakdown product of a blood clot, and levels of this substance may be measured in the bloodstream. Blood clots are not stagnant; the body tries to dissolve them at the same time as a new clot is being added. D-dimer is not specific for a blood clot in a given area and cannot distinguish the difference between a \\\"good\\\" (necessary) blood clot (one that forms after surgery or due to bruising from a fall) from one that is causing problems. It is used as a screening test in patients with low probability of having a blood clot. In this case, if the result is negative, there is no need to search further for the diagnosis of blood clots.Additional tests: Should a blood clot embolize to the lung, this may be a medical emergency. There are a variety of tests to look for pulmonary emboli. A plain chest X-ray will not show blood clots, but may be done to look for other conditions that can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, the same sings and symptoms of an embolus. The electrocardiogram (EKG) may show abnormalities suggestive of a pulmonary embolus and may also show other reasons for chest pain.Computerized tomography (CT) is often the test of choice when suspicion of pulmonary embolus is high. Contrast is injected intravenously, and the radiologist can determine whether a clot is present.On occasion, ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scans are performed to look for pulmonary emboli. This test uses labeled chemicals to identify inhaled air into the lungs and match it with blood flow in the arteries. This test is less accurate than a CT scan and is subjective to variances in interpretation.Should a pulmonary embolus be diagnosed, the amount of clot and potential severity of the disease may require further testing. Echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart that may be used to decide how much strain the blood clot in the lung is causing on the heart.Testing for arterial blood clotsArterial thrombosis is an emergency, since tissue cannot survive very long without blood supply before there is irreversible damage. In an arm or leg, often a surgeon is immediately consulted. Arteriography may be considered. Arteriography is a technique in which dye is injected into the artery in question to look for blockage. Sometimes, if there is a large artery that is occluded, this test is done in the operating room with the presumption that a surgical procedure will be necessary to open the vessel and restore blood flow.For an acute heart attack, the EKG may confirm the diagnosis, although blood tests also may be used to look for enzymes (troponin) that leak into the bloodstream from irritated heart muscle.

If the stroke symptoms resolve, meaning that a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has occurred, tests may include carotid ultrasound to look for blockage in the major arteries of the neck and echocardiography to look for blood clots in the heart that may embolize to the brain. Continue ReadingWhat is the medical treatment for blood clotsDepending upon their location, blood clots may be aggressively treated or may need nothing more than symptomatic care.Venous thrombosis in the leg may occur in the superficial or deep systems of veins.Clots in the superficial system are often treated symptomatically with warm compresses and acetaminophen or ibuprofen since there is no risk for clots in the superficial veins to embolize to the lung. They are connected to the deep system by perforator veins that have valves that act like a sieve to strain and prevent clots from traveling to the lung.Deep venous thrombosis usually requires anticoagulation to prevent the clot from growing and causing a pulmonary embolus. Treatment tends to occur in an outpatient setting using medications that anticoagulate or \\\"thin\\\" the blood. There are a variety of medications available to treat blood clots.The American College of Chest Physicians has published guidelines regarding the type of blood thinners to be considered in the treatment of blood clots in the legs or in the lungs.In patients with DVT or PE and no active cancer, the drug of choice is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC), also known as a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) because of where they block the coagulation cascade to thin the blood.NOACs that block clotting Factor Xa include:apixaban (Eliquis)rivoroxiban (Xarelto)edoxiban (Savaysa)dabigatran is another NOAC that is a direct thrombin inhibitor.In patients with DVT or PE and active cancer, the recommended medication is low molecular weight heparin or enoxaparin (Lovenox).In unstable patients, or those where there is concern that they will become unstable in the near future, and who need hospitalization, the anticoagulation drug that is recommended is intravenous unfractionated heparin. When there is a large amount of blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, strain can be put on the heart and lung function and thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) drugs, so-called clot busting drugs, might be considered. These patients are usually critically ill and in shock.If there is massive amount of clot in the femoral or iliac veins, no blood may be able to leave the leg and it becomes massively engorged, swollen and blue. This is called phlegmasia cerulia dolens and may require treatment with tPA.

In patients who have increasing shortness of breath or weakness, hospitalization may be required during the initial treatment phase. In certain situations, when there are large amounts of blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, strain can be put on the heart and lung function and thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) drugs, so-called clot busting drugs, might be considered. These patients are usually critically ill and in shock.Arterial blood clots are often managed more aggressively. Surgery may be attempted to remove the clot, or medication may be administered directly into the clot to try to dissolve it. Alteplase (Activase, tPA) or tenecteplase (TNKase) are examples of clot busting medications that may be used in peripheral arteries to try to restore blood supply.Heart attack: The same approach for heart attack is used as for arterial blood clots. If possible, cardiac catheterization is performed to locate the blocked blood vessel and a balloon is used to open it, restore blood flow, and a stent is placed to keep it open. This is a time-sensitive procedure and if a local hospital is unable to perform a heart catheterization emergently, within 60-90 minutes of the patient's arrival to medical care, thrombolytic medications described above like tPA or TNK may be used intravenously to try to dissolve the thrombus and minimize heart muscle damage. There will still be the need to eventually transfer the patient when stable to a hospital with the capability to perform heart catheterizations.Stroke also is treated with tPA if the patient is an appropriate candidate for this treatment. Each patient is different and may or may not qualify for this medication with an acute stroke. Again, this is a time sensitive emergency and in addition to tPA, an interventional radiologist may be able to insert a catheter into the blood vessels of the brain, identify the clot and remove it, thus hopefully reversing the stroke.

She blames me for abusing her as a child & again the past 5 years. My husband & I have noticed a slow decline in her mental health the past 5 years, a few years ago I offered to go & help with the children etc as at that stage she wasn t well & blamed her unwellness on mental fatigue due to lack of sleep as the 2 youngest boys are 18 months apart the elder one 6 years older. She said neither of the little ones would sleep at night. She cried when I offered to go to her, she could tell me enough how thankful she was & how much she loved me. During that visit a few days before my husband & I were to come home she entered the room I was in closed the door she lent against the door to prevent me from leaving & verbally tore me to shreds for it seemed like an hour or 2 but maybe 3/4 of an hour. Every time I tried to talk she would harshly tell me to be quite & listen as I never listed to her all her life, I was in tears her husband was sleeping after night work, my husband didn t realize there was an issue behind the closed door upstairs. She accused me of things that never ever happened, greatly exaggerated incidences etc. Since her text message informing me never to contact them she has spoken to her father occasionally but when he mentions how much we miss her & our Grandson & we love her greatly would she please let Mum talk to our Grandsons. She instantly becomes very aggressive & tells my husband exaggerated or completely false accusations about me. My husband & I attended Counselling to try to understand & accept I am unable to have contact with my precious daughter & Grandsons. Our eldest Grandson was 11 years old last year when this began he was extremely close to us he would always get very upset even feeling sick when it was time for us to come home after visiting them he would beg us not to go home. Prior to last year we tried to visit them twice a year for about 2 weeks at a time. After the time she barracked me & abused me harshly we never stayed in there home again we took our caravan & stayed in our van. WE did send our Grandchildren a birthday present each last year as all there birthdays are early in the year. After about 4 months no contact with them my heart ached so much for them all I phoned there home leaving a message telling her how much she means to me ,I love her greatly,apologized for phoning when I had been told not to make any contact, but said I just ached so much for them & just had tell her in my own voice how much I loved her & always would, I promised I would not ever phone again without her permission. I have kept my word. 2 weeks after I made this phone call I received a letter by registered mail from her husband who we always previous to her text message to me we got on really well we have always felt he was a very fair honest understanding man. His letter to me stated if I ever attempted to contact her or them again they would have no choice but to take a restraining order out on me. he stated they were moving house & we would not know where they would live. Our daughter changed her mobile phone number, the only contact we have available is our son-in-laws mobile number. I never have tried to contact them since. Our daughter has phoned my husband on occasions & has told him he can phone her husbands mobile anytime, he has only done so twice as every conversation with her she ends up making false accusations about me & he becomes very upset a stressed. he & I discussed many times prior to last Christmas how we both hurt so much missing contact with our Grandsons, eventually my husband said the boys need to know we love them & we both felt we wanted to post Christmas presents to our daughter & family.", "start_char_idx": 31302, "end_char_idx": 35749, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "600e179b-80f9-48a9-828d-497c5dbc43be": {"__data__": {"id_": "600e179b-80f9-48a9-828d-497c5dbc43be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b01d336-f414-42c4-b579-2f871e0843ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "b04d7853f0ba339d6b147e900ef7f88eb14c827fd7166e4a2cfeea7b5085d9de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d980d129-08a8-4ffb-bb38-bd2fbdd6b8f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f4a49ed21f03fc276a5926c4fdc2017e3c9e558b050f47bd7ad51d9b4b17471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "His letter to me stated if I ever attempted to contact her or them again they would have no choice but to take a restraining order out on me. he stated they were moving house & we would not know where they would live.

My husband phoned our son-in-law hoping to have a good talk with him how our daughter was & if we could both talk to our Grandsons plus about sending presents to them all or at least to our Grandsons, Our son-in-law did not talk to my husband long enough to be asked any questions, he put our daughter on to talk, my husband asked her what suburb did they live in, she would not tell him, he asked if we could send Christmas presents & if the 3 boys were still interested in there favourite play games, she said yes they were. My husband said he would go shopping & buy them some for Christmas so where could he post them too. Her reply was she would have to think about it. She allowed her 3 sons to talk to there Grandad all were very happy to talk to him. My husband when talking to the eldest one asked if he could have another talk with his Dad. With that our daughter came back on the phone asking why did he want to talk to her husband again etc etc & made up what seemed like excuses why it wasn t possible. She then went down her path of accusing all her problems etc etc is caused by me & my constant abuse. She would not listen to my husband who knows & tried to tell her it wasn t right. They are very devoted Christians, we are also but not as devoted as they are. Last December our daughter phoned my husband at work, he couldn t talk very long, she informed him she & her husband did not want presents from us. She told my husband then that Mum (me) made our Grandaughter who lives with our ex daughter in law . She is our only other grandchild aged 7 she lives a long way from us but we see her regularly when she comes to stay with her Dad ( our son), Our daughter told my husband I had made our Grand daughter use not her own fathers phone but our other sons mobile phone to phone our daughter as I was trying to find out where they lived. This accusation was so far fetched as our son only has a work mobile has it all the time as he is on call 24x7 he was 3 hours away all the weekend our daughter claimed I had our Granddaughter make this phone call. I am at my witts end why my daughter makes up these story s blaming me for anything & everything. Just prior to Christmas we sent our Grandsons presents to our son in laws parents address as that was the only address we new to send it to, we included a card with love a best wishes to our daughter & son- in-law from us both. Christmas eve we received an email from our son-in-law stating how disrespectful we are to our daughter & him as our daughter had requested not to contact them, how dare I go against our daughters request that we do not send any of them Christmas presents or involve his parents she had request we were not to do.My husband was not told this at all. The email told us they were undecided if they would give our presents to there sons. We felt totally devastated. This is NOT what our daughter told her father. My husband & I want our daughters mental health to recover but do not understand why or how our daughter has reason for this vendetta against me. We did not reply to the email. We have 2 sons younger than our daughter I talked to each of them individually & insisted if they felt I miss treated there sister in any way I needed to know so I could seek further Counselling as I want our family all reunited. both sons insisted it is her problem not mine, I was & always have been a good caring mother to each of them.", "start_char_idx": 34878, "end_char_idx": 39174, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d980d129-08a8-4ffb-bb38-bd2fbdd6b8f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d980d129-08a8-4ffb-bb38-bd2fbdd6b8f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "600e179b-80f9-48a9-828d-497c5dbc43be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "b73e37271090e7b549a8e9c0647e6f60798a8cd63b12bb0c64c25ee023456acc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1509e52-f7a8-46f3-b8e8-3a9c582c8722", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b9195b7c56b52e26cfdd9c39b98d5682cfd2e85307905b2aa2e4c73a0cc8df1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The email told us they were undecided if they would give our presents to there sons.

One son has suffered major depression for quite a few years he did on occasions take a step back from my husband & myself but never said he never wanted to see us again, at one time he did blame us alternately,it would be me other times my husband for his depression, we stood by him helped him seek medical help. He finally accepted it was his problem & he has been well for several years now, he came home from staying with his sister a few years ago & said to me, Mum you have bigger worry s with her than you ve got or had with me. He has not wanted to get involved in his sisters issues with us as he said it is not his problem or ours it is her problem she has to accept that & deal with it. we understand he knows his ability to cope with certain situations we do not burden him with his sisters problems. He did tell us she contacted him & asked him not tell us they were communicating etc, finally he told us as he knew how worried we were for her. He told us they occasionally communicated for over 6 months he told her that we all only have one & Mum & Dad neither of them (us) have good health. You need to accept them as & who they are as they done the best they could under difficult circumstances when they where kids so let the past be the past. She hasn t spoken to him since. Our other son at the beginning phone her several times left messages that he heard she wasn t well he was wonder how she was. She never returned his calls after she changed her phone number he did phone her husband a few times leaving a message he was concerned how they all were but he never heard from them. I did tell my Councillor of the issues I had rearing my children especially anything to do with our daughter, she was not cause us any great concerns or disputes He confirmed I done nothing beyond normality as a parent. I have asked my daughter for forgiveness years ago when she started to change towards me I could feel there was a wall started to build between us , that maybe there where occasions if I had my time over again as a mother I would react differently but at the time I done what I thought was best for each of my children if unintentionally there where things that has now affected her I am greatly sorry & asked her to forgive me. Nothing came from my attempt to help her & understand where she was at. I did tell my son in law about this time I felt my daughter needed help, he didn t answer or ask me why. I never broached the subject or took it any further with either of them. My big question right now as it is approaching our Grandsons birthdays soon, what do we do? We do not what them to feel we don t love or care for them we have no idea what reasons they have been given that we don t phone them, visit etc etc. We don t know if they did receive there Christmas gifts. What do you advise us to do in regards to there coming birthdays. Our Councillor is off on sick leave so have not been able to meet with him for quite sometime we live in a small country town & have our name on the waiting list to see a visiting Physiologist. When our eldest Grandson was about 3 our daughter when going overseas for work for a week asked me to care for her son at there home during the day when her husband was at work. I happily did & there were no issues what so ever.

From the history you have mentioned and age of the onset of her symptoms it appears that her diagnosis of Psychosis is correct and probably she is suffering from Schizophrenia. A lot of factors affected her psychological development like migrating from India to USA and then due to fear from boys and change in culture she was migrated again to India. Over protective parenting also resulted in increased pressure on her like her decision to remain \\\"holy\\\" even you were aware of this and this is not a expected behaviour. Her symptoms started with muttering and later progressed to violent episodes. Initially she was well with quetiapine but later due to shifting to USA her symptoms relapsed. She developed hyper prolactenimia due to risperidone and this has resulted in galactorrhoea. She failed to respond to Quetiapine again. Aripiprazole has cause intolerance and mood changes and Extra pyramidal side effects. Neurotransmitter studies revealed abnormal receptor functionsAs per my opinion she should underwent one MRI scan of brain with special target to pituitary ares. Porlactin increase to such levels with such doses of Risperidone is no so common. MRI will rule out any prolactinoma or other tumour. Once it is ruled out then we can think about other medicines. Olanzapine is relatively better tolerated and is safer. Clozapine can also be considered as a good option. The drug is useful for resistant symptoms and have excellent efficacy. You can discuss with your psychiatrist regarding prescription of these drugs. Both drugs will help in sleep also.Thanks hope this helps you.

We started our USA life in Florida on 2001. She started her study at 5th grade. We have two children (Son and daughter). She is our youngest one. 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she was studying in 10th grade (2005 year), A big hurricane hit our house window glass and burst. At that time we were praying in another bedroom. That wind burst our bed room window where we were praying burst outward. She feared very lot at that time but she has no problem at that time. 2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day she was taking shower after her school some boys hit her bath room. She feared, ran to sitting room and could not speak some. My wife asked so many times, after some times she told her this incident. Our house was on ground floor.This was the second incident. 3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After one year, when she was studying in 11th grade, some boys bothered her so much. She told me that no one never touched her but they teased her with words like prostitute etc. when she travel by school bus or she was studying in school because she is nice, beautiful. So they tried to attract but failed. She needs to live holy, doesn\u2019t want American people life. She didn\u2019t know who is working in background. At last she found told us that one of boys is living above our apartment house. Her tension increased, one day we noticed that she is smiling and talking herself. This was starting point.

So they tried to attract but failed. She needs to live holy, doesn\u2019t want American people life. She didn\u2019t know who is working in background. At last she found told us that one of boys is living above our apartment house. Her tension increased, one day we noticed that she is smiling and talking herself. This was starting point. We admitted in hospital and discharged from hospital after 10 days. They gave Seroquel tablet. We found that our daughter will not get peace if she stays in our apartment house. So I sent daughter and my wife to India in February 2007. We admitted her in hospital, Kerala India and they doubted, it may be Schizophrenia. They gave medicines Night: Quetiapine (Ingredients: Substituted for Seroquel) Morning: RIZ LS - Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Orodispersible tablet (Ingredients: Risperidone BP 2 mg, Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride IP 2 mg) When she was taking, she told us that she cannot look naked body when she bath or change her dress and she is hearing voice. My wife told this problem then doctor told her that ignores it. My wife didn\u2019t know that it was medicine side effects. 7 years she suffered these problems and she studied 11th, 12th and graduated B.Sc. in year 2013 with very good marks. I got a new job in Texas, USA on June 2012. So I moved from Florida to Houston. So we decided to bring my wife and our daughter to here (Texas, USA) and our daughter can continue her education. They came here on July 2013. At that time she was taking medicines as follows. Night: Quetiapine 50 mg (Ingredients: Substituted for Seroquel 50 mg) Morning: RIZ LS - Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Orodispersible tablet (Ingredients: Risperidone BP 2 mg, Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride IP 2 mg) As per our doctor s instruction india, we reduced medicine from Quetiapine 50 mg to Quetiapine 25 mg (bed time). On 2014 March 2nd night (after one month), She couldn t sleep, so I brought her to Hospital Emergency Room on March 3rd morning. They tested her blood but they didn t give any medicine and discharged from hospital. Then I called our doctor in India, he told me that increase medicine Quetiapine 25 mg to Quetiapine 50 mg. So we gave Quetiapine 50 mg on March 3rd night but she couldn t sleep again. So I brought her to Emergency Room (Mid night). At that time she was very nice to talk to us. They admitted her on March 4th evening on patient care. So doctors stopped all medicine then she has no problem and she can sleep without any issue. Also she can look her naked body when she was bathing and she has no hearing voices etc after stopping these medicines. Everything happened because of these medicines side effect. Next day they discharged from hospital and prescribed started Risperidone 2 mg and Benadryl tab 25 mg bed time only for safety. They didn t check prolactin level before giving Risperidone tab. I was watching her and found that something is going on her but she has no issue. Her period (menses) started March 3rd, 2014. After taking this medicine 18 days, her period was started again. Then I identified, it is an issue of this medicine. We got appointment after 5 days as per hospital referral doctor. March 26, 2014, we consulted the doctor and I told her the problem. Doctor didn t believe my words. Because of my request, doctor wrote prescription to test prolactin level. We gave her blood on March 28, 2014 Friday and Lab told, they will send result to doctor on Monday March 31, 2014.", "start_char_idx": 45731, "end_char_idx": 49681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32e59c7e-6155-4b65-a12b-b984653c2254": {"__data__": {"id_": "32e59c7e-6155-4b65-a12b-b984653c2254", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f0fe668-5d59-4317-a775-b74355f5255c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "a8d7602e9b5068f288982d2575d0ec13402b562568eb9f9270cd3b18e424fe8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2d7dcba-26ec-485f-8c39-3b654cb552f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "136cb1a54b96c23f669667982cc5672a4c8011ebccaa24f52d63e2cd0627fc1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They didn t check prolactin level before giving Risperidone tab.

Friday after noon, she was completely changed and she was throwing all old dress to garbage, tore old photos, documents and etc. Next day again worst, she throws all disliked items to garbage. I contacted doctor but she didn t change medicine. Two times I brought her to hospital, they didn\u2019t believe our words. I am not able to stop medicine without right help. At last again brought her to our hospital Emergency Depart, there duty doctor stopped this medicine and prescribed a tablet to sleep and discharged. The doctor told us to contact our follow up doctor on morning. We gave this sleeping tab at midnight and then she slept on that night. Morning, we went to doctor s office, at that time, doctor got prolactin result and result was abnormal (124.5) which is 6 times more than the maximum (18). She changed medicine quetiapine 50 mg in night (bed time) and Quetiapine 25 mg morning only. Doctor didn t give any medicine for Risperidone internal reaction. One week, we suffered very lot and found that our daughter\u2019s tendency \u201cto throw old dress\u201d which was not completely cured. We found another good doctor (Neuro Psychiatrist) and changed appointment to him. During this period, we tested Neuro transmitter test and found that Dopamine is normal but DOPAC level is low. We tested neurotransmitters (after her periods) from urine (They told give 2nd urine to avoid any medicine trace). Neurotransmitters: Serotonin (5 HT), Catecholamine (Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine), GABA (Gamma- Amino butyric acid level), Glutamate, R/E Ratio, Glycine, PEA (Beta-phnylethylamine level), Acetylcholine, Endorphin, Melatonin. A test result, DOPAC is low and others are fine. The new doctor told Quetiapine is also allergic to her. He told us that Risperidone damaged her brain which affected her thyroid gland function and hormone. He gave Latuda 20 mg in night only. After some blood test we found that her Vitamin D is low. Doctor told that it will affect her mood. So doctor prescribed vitamin D. After giving 3 days vitamin D medicine, our daughter told that she feels snake crawling on her body. Next day we watched and gave vitamin D to her, after one hour our daughter was alerted and she told snake strangling her neck also. So we contacted doctor and he looked her problem. Doctor told it is hormone sensitivity which was caused by Risperidone. He stopped vitamin D and prescribed a tablet to decrease prolactin level and prescribed a medicine to increase thyroid function. After 2-3 days giving this medicine, our daughter\u2019s mood were changed, the doctor stopped these medicines and referred to hospital. One week, our daughter was admitted this hospital. This hospital told us that her disease may be some kind of Psychosis. So the doctor prescribed the medicine Abilify 5mg(aripiprazole) and Activan (Lorazepam 0.5 mg) twice a day. We told doctor that she is going back to home country India to take master degree or other professional degree. Her mood is changing in her period\u2019s time. Also if she eats any item with ingredients Corn her mood will change (eg: Oats). As per our watching, something is connected to her hormone. They left to India again. One doctor in India, increased Ablify and gave another tablet \u2018pacitane tablet\u2019 to remove side effects but she fell down unconsciously two times.

My wife told doctor that Risperidone is severe allergic to her. Two days before we found that her behavior is changing, we tested prolactin which is elevated from 5.5 to 45 within 10 days. My wife told but doctor is not considering these changes. If prolactin increase Here is the list of behavior change happened in USA 1) The habit of doing/telling lies (Same thing happened in kerala today when my wife observed Our daughter, she pretend sleep on bed tonight and also she covered her body with blanket {which used in cold weather} when the atmosphere was very hot now in kerala.) 2) She sits alone on a room and anyone comes to room, she will get out from there. (This happened in kerala one day before). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3) She took important items and throws them in trash. 4) She tore photos and valuable documents. 5) She loses touch with reality and starts talking non-sense After all these behavior changes, we suffered 3 months to bring back our daughter at least 50% with her right behavior. Doctor in USA told, Risperidone tab affected her pituitary gland and prolactin level based on blood test results. So we cannot continue this medicine. We need right treatment. Now she is allergic to Corn, Soy, Pistachio, Walnut, Corn Oil and Quetiapine tab, Risperidone tab, Vitamin D tab, RIS-LZ tab. We need proper help to bring back our daughter with her nice behavior with minimum medicine. All these issues happened after giving Risperidone. What is will be alternate medicine for Sizodone. If we give aripiprazole tab, only issue is, some mood changes (not always).

This is my sheer letter of desperation, and in need of HELP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!  - hopefully whoever is reading this will pass this on and keep this letter forward as I need to fight for my dad in some way as he is fighting for his life. Please take the time to read his story, and perhaps someone out there can hear my calling and assist me\u2026  Here goes\u2026 My father whom is 65 years old, a man of incredible strength , super fit at his age, strong , motivated and helpful in more ways than words can say to others, had fallen seriously ill !!! My mother passed away from cancer suddenly in 2 weeks being in hospital they also found out the cancer too late, she died on the 24 April 2008.  We all went thru bad depression, but all have recovered... so first thing before anyone diagnoses my dad\u2019s problem related to my mom\u2019s passing is wrong. That I can promise you.   So on to getting to the bottom of my father\u2019s terrible road \u2026 of illness My dad started to show signs of shortness of breath , and he seemed to be using a lot of his neck muscles to do the work,  from being a super fit martial artist , to being short of breathe on walking distances became odd.  He complained about being so tired all the time, he just could not sleep enough even though he was sleeping regularly and often in the day too. his appetite started to subside  from being a very big eater  loving his red meats , to having lost cravings for any such  food , and at times skipped many meals , and over the past few months had been losing weight ,  of course to some extent being alone since my mother past had a bit of an effect ,  however all of us children sent him to three different GP doctors and he had blood tests done and apparently all was fine. They informed him it was possibly anxiety and stress, depression, and put him on anti \u2013 depressants, of which made him even more tired,  so he would take them occasionally but did not finish his course..   Also in beginning he would lose a bit of his voice and try clear it when he spoke ,  doctors thought it was reflux , ulcers and heartburn , prescribed nexiam ,  He always complained about his tummy, his stomach gave him a lot of problems first would be constipated and then it would be diarrhea, he kept on saying it felt like a blockage of some sort... but continues with some laxitives. He went back to the doctors a few times complaining he was not getting better , they kept giving him vitamin b injections and prescribing more meds \u2026  He then tried a natural route of which I suggested, he spoke to a holistic doctor and gave him a good few different natural anti biotic etc... After a few weeks he felt a little better, but still not well, he just seemed to be getting worse.  Back at doctors and said he had high blood pressure, he had days when he was dizzy and bad headaches, and his muscles cramped a lot.  Those where all his symptoms \u2026  Now after my mother passed he moved up to the lodge (farm ) where he was quite far away from us in the city and drove frequently up to see some clients of what he had left , he lost much work due to his health .  On this particular day , he was not well he stayed over at my brothers house and eventually could not sleep nicely through the night , he had to sit in a chair as it felt like he could not breathe he said it felt like his stomach was causing much discomfort and could not breath when laying down .   He was very stubborn too and does not like doctors and has never been to doctor or hospitals in his life as he has been super healthy all his life.  His biggest fear was hospitals.", "start_char_idx": 55566, "end_char_idx": 59814, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07153b45-7899-4815-8823-5366d57bfb9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "07153b45-7899-4815-8823-5366d57bfb9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef97504f-3a1e-44b0-983d-f3a885dc4558", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "ac14542becc18557ac28202e82948d024e9b17fe1d8161e086978a804dc3e554", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df876901-c7c5-4668-92ab-a585844acfac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5924616c2c05d394876af7fe9dfcd5d87c807e72bd6336466d847eec4e77a34a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Back at doctors and said he had high blood pressure, he had days when he was dizzy and bad headaches, and his muscles cramped a lot.

He was very stubborn too and does not like doctors and has never been to doctor or hospitals in his life as he has been super healthy all his life.  His biggest fear was hospitals. On the 14 JULY 2010 After much convincing and him finally agreeing he was seriously ill, we took him to hospital where they did x rays and put him on a drip in casualty, upon awaiting results etc \u2026 his blood pressure dropped to a severe low that they had to have him elevated as to not incur and brain damage and loss of blood to the brain, they gave him adrenaline and volvuven to stabiles blood pressure and he then went in to respiratory arrest.  Because my father does not have medical aid and we were at a private hospital casualty, we had to call on Johannesburg general hospital known as charlotte maxeke hospital. And try getting a bed in the ICU ward over there. Thank goodness he was accepted, but he has to be intubated in the mean time at the casualty, with a pipe in his throat.  And he was unconscious, the doctors consulted and said he was unable to be transported to the government hospital as one he was unstable to be and secondly we were awaiting a bed for him at the hospital.  The doctors had informed us on my father\u2019s state and told us that it was between GOD and the Medicine and that was the hope we got...  The following day my father opened his eyes and was awake, the government hospital had a bed ready for him. He was transported to the hospital, and was admitted in the ICU ward there.  They had mentioned he had pneumonia in both lungs etc, they treated him and within a week he went from being intubated and respiratory arrest to being discharged into a respiratory ward for two days, and then discharged on 22 July 2010 with some anti biotic to take home and scheduled further follow ups to be conducted thereafter.  However on the 23rd July just the next day he was not feeling too good again, we got a ICU nurse to stay with him and we monitored him, but he was not coping and started breaking into a sweat, eventually we took him back to hospital however they would not take him back straight away and we had to go through the casualty which was terrible, the attending doc on that night was terrible, left my dad, and we had to queue.. Instead of prioritizing patients... my dad was given oxygen mask, however starting to sweat even more and becam lymph and passing out battling to remain conscious... I begged and pleased and my brother too tried to speak to the doctor whom did not want to help , eventually one of the male nurses and practicing doctor a young man helped me , and said we need to intubate your father , at that point I had to help assist in the recuss room , and the again the main doctor on duty simply did not lift a hand to help\u2026 although the young man was not completely well trained , he managed to sort my father out and  eventually a lady doctor from respiratory ward whom knew my father\u2019s case  had assisted and reprimanded the on duty doctor for his  lack of assistance.. Finally dad was intubated and stabilized; he had to stay in an open room in casualty stable until; a bed was available in the ICU ward. And was admitted in the ICU ward on the 24 July 2010 for the second time.  Till Today he is still in that same place \u2026 he has had many doctors and professors and academics\u2019 from that hospital have a look at him, they have done ct scans, Mir\u2019s and have been told they have done every test that they can, I have asked and requested a list of the tests done and the results, and awaiting this.", "start_char_idx": 58955, "end_char_idx": 63179, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df876901-c7c5-4668-92ab-a585844acfac": {"__data__": {"id_": "df876901-c7c5-4668-92ab-a585844acfac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "07153b45-7899-4815-8823-5366d57bfb9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "1fcb9be7c1f7bb3e8854e36c14b361715053967dfe705f7e56269961704f0aad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "158c2350-f216-4c8a-bc42-80596b519e34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a897500ad6d48f377dff82aa0cde45870a050eb5680dc61ca5de8351099bbeaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "And was admitted in the ICU ward on the 24 July 2010 for the second time.

We have been reassured these are all the good  best doctors and the professor is apparently well known and the \u201cguru\u201d\u2026 sadly that my father\u2019s case seems to be one of a rare kind and the cannot  get a definitive diagnoses for my father  , he has had a cervical fusion done to release compression that was on nerves ,  he has had a tracheostromy  and is on a ventilator , they have suspected it be \u201cMYSTHENIA GRAVIS\u201d ,  and have been treating him for this , he has lost so much weight , during all this he has incurred episodes of respiratory failure again as they try wean him off ventilator and then  the co 2 levels  go up so much that he has also been in a comatose state , for two days , and he has severe up and down days ,,. Some days he looks like he responding well to the medication, and some days looks terrible, there has been so many tests and most of them have been clear and negative to anything \u2026. So the closest is the myasthenia gravis of what I am told.   They do physic on him every day I am told and that they try sit him in the chair but some days he is too ill to do so but they say it is mandatory to his improvement and progress; they also have him on plasma dialysis. During the time he has been in hospital  he has incurred a bedsore of which first operated on in theatre , proper post maintenance was not done and the bed sore got worse , so more debridement had to be done. Again they had to take him to theatre to debraid and cut the bed sore which is situated just above his bum towards the lower back.   Just before the op, he had lost so much blood from the bed sore they had to give him 23 units of blood.  At this point his bed sore is not as painful as it was, however now he has diarrhea that has been for 6 days now, when it began they even put a catheter in his bum coz it was so uncontrolled, dad has not eaten in a very long time and has a feed tube in. he drinks lots of fluids.  At this point however helpful doctors have been whether comforting or not... this is about my father and he is fighting he is not giving up, he says he wants to get better and as he is fighting... I am fighting here for him too, I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP!! SOMETHING, GOD TO BLESS THE DOCTORS WITH MORE IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH DAD, ,  no more tests have been scheduled as far as I know , says the one doctor , so now what ??

MRI report shows presence of tuberculoma. Worried and confused. Medical cure for this?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hi,Thank you for posting this query.I have gone through the details of your symptoms, MRI spine, CT scan brain and the complication you have developed following CESI  (cervical epidural steroid injection) diligently. I understand your pain and have multiple unanswered questions. I shall proceed to provide my opinion which I hope can help you. Should you have any doubts/have unanswered questions, please write back to me. Your MRI cervical spine is consistent  with uncovertebral arthropathy resulting in moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 and mild to moderate left foraminal  stenosis as C6-7.Uncovertebral joints are formed between uncinate processes below, and the uncus above. They are located in the cervical region of the vertebral column between C3 and C6. Two lips project upward from the superior surface of the vertebral body below, and one projects downward from the inferior surface of vertebral body above. They allow for flexion and extension and limit lateral flexion in the cervical spine. Arthropathy is a degenerative disease and in your case involving these jointsRepeat MRI cervical spine following CESI also reveals the same arthropathy of uncovertebral joints but in different radiology words. These means the major complication - which include Dural and epidural hematoma, epidural abscess, spinal cord rupture, infarction of spinal cord - following CESI has been ruled out. Further compication following CESI depends upon the approaches (which you have not mentioned). By now you would have known that CESI done by two approaches interlaminar and transforaminal approach.

Therefore my suggestions for you in view of your unbearable pain and neuralgic symptoms are1) Get hospitalized for observation, vitals monitoring, Neurological observation for meningeal signs , and deficits .Take bed rest and IV fluids for hydration. Coffee can be continued. 2) A short course intravenous steroids such as intravenous dexamethasone can be given to take care of arachnoiditis and chemical meningitis (if any)3) Flupirtine maleate can be used to relieve painful symptoms.4) Get your blood tested - blood count, ESR, blood culture and blood sugar. The test preferable should be done before starting steroids5) If total leucocyte count is raised, you may require CSF penetrans antibiotics parenterally (ceftriaxone + Staphylococcal sensitive antibiotics) to take care of bacterial infectionThe above regiment should take care of your symptoms by a week's time. Else blood dural patch can be considered. As such, the autologous blood does not \\\"repair\\\" the leak, but rather treats the symptoms. Discuss with your treating doctor/neurologist about this protocol of evaluation and treatment.Finally - Is there a notable risk that there could be more compression and damage to the thecal sac if I have the blood patch in the thoracic regionAns: Your query regarding further worsening of thecal sac after patch is not possible as indentation are at cervical disc level and patch is planned at thoracic level.RegardsDr sandhya ManorenjNeurologistHi tech city Hyderabad \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hello. I had a cervical epidural injection for neck pain and arm numbness and pain (all on the left side) 11 days ago. I was under under anesthesia for the procedure but did not notice any concerning pain upon waking. When I went home for recovery I had severe soreness, enough I could barely sleep. but it seemed to get better after three days. Six days after the injection I felt the injection site still looked like a hump on my back and that I was having severe occipital neuralgia up the back of my head. My neurologist gave me topamax and told me to visit with my pain management specialist that gave me the injection. I tried to get a hold of him for two days and could not get a phone call returned (since the day before I went to the neurologist). Because my pain increased and I developed the worst headache of my life, like something was sitting inside my skull and hurting the front of my face and the nerves on the back of my head have become so sensitive I cannot touch them without my head feeling like it is going to explode or is on fire from pressure and pain, I went to the hospital the Friday (I think day seven, maybe day 8) after the procedure. The ER Drs. thought it might be a spinal headache because of the pain locations, however, the headache did not, and does not, get immediately better when I am flat, and because it presented itself almost a week away from the injection it made the diagnosis unclear. The Emergency room surgeon talked to me and said even if it is a dural puncture that no one does cervical blood patches because they are too dangerous. They did a CT scan that only showed only a 10 mm sublenticular cyst, incidentally noted on the right side. They sent me home with pain meds and steroids and told me to come back if the pain worsens. I went again to the hospital on sunday night, day 10, due to increased pain at site of injection and increased feeling of pain and pressure in neck and head. Also, when I would lay flat on my back the pressure on the back of my head and/or injection site caused me to feel like my blood pressure around my head was terrible and my heart rate would rise suddenly or fall suddenly .", "start_char_idx": 69560, "end_char_idx": 74061, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0e3d47e-9925-4b1d-a16e-45cab4feae59": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0e3d47e-9925-4b1d-a16e-45cab4feae59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67a95b44-f540-4367-bab9-73aa535f64af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "fb57fa1d5d73e6c0dcad6b240c0ebda60fbf6e1ca74494ee6fb1b52b1f7546bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5483198a-4917-46f9-90d6-e2b5c8f5b5e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b0968546583df0b0efbf8015b9f8504a7e6b8726b6381df8d80284a032c61c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Emergency room surgeon talked to me and said even if it is a dural puncture that no one does cervical blood patches because they are too dangerous.

Also, when I would lay flat on my back the pressure on the back of my head and/or injection site caused me to feel like my blood pressure around my head was terrible and my heart rate would rise suddenly or fall suddenly . I am unsure if this was due to stress or related to the cause of my pain. The ER doctor ordered an MRI. He said there was nothing that gave him an idea as to what exactly was causing the problem and suggested it was some sort complication from the injection but could not tell if it was just irritation or something else. I was sent home and told to contact my pain management Dr. I noticed there was a small difference in the MRI findings and I want to post the original MRI impressions and the post epidural injection MRI impression and ask that you explain the differences. The pain management Dr. said that the differences were really only in the wording from the different radiologists. There is a specific part that I am interested in. The reason I want to have this explained is because my pain management Dr. seemed very certain there was nothing he could do for me and my symptoms and then after asking him what direction I should take and if I should see a specialist he said he wanted to try a cervical blood patch in two days. He wants me to stay home and rest and drink caffeine and see if I improve. He said my symptoms represent some aspects of a spinal dural puncture headache but others do not. If I had no improvement in these two days he will go ahead with the blood patch in the thoracic region right below the original injection site. By the time I went in for this office visit I could only lay on my side for some relief. Laying on the cervical site or on my head or standing made things worse. However, as I am typing this the pain and pressure has increased and I am no longer able to lay down at all in any direction for relief. It is very scary, as you can imagine. There is also more stiffness around my neck and spine and down my back. It feels like there is just a tight squeeze on my spine. The heaviness inside my head is not letting up. The point of this is that I called him tonight to discuss whether I should be seen in the ER due to worsening symptoms. He said no and to rest and we will do the blood patch in two days. I asked about alternative diagnosis possibilities because he says he is unclear of the diagnosis and the only other possibility we talked about was a cervical hematoma because of the pressure and pain at the injection site. He said this is unlikely, however, because of how long it was been since the injection and because the MRI did not pick up on it. I reminded him that the MRI did not pick up on a dural puncture and he also said that the spinal headache was a small chance as well. If both a hematoma and a dural punture are low possibilities, but possibilities, why does he choose to one possibility over the other? Also, if there is pressure on my spinal cord and he attempts the blood patch, this pressure will increase and might cause harm if it is not a dural puncture, but in fact is a hematoma or some other pressure issue on my dural sac or spinal cord. How do I know the difference? How does he? Should he be preforming this cervical blood patch without the consult of experienced surgeons about alternative diagnosis or risks considering he is uncertain as to the diagnosis? Should he be preforming a cervical blood patch in a surgical center? Would I be better off in the hospital for the procedure in case of emergency complications? What would you do if it was you or your loved one? Please think carefully and let me know your advice. This is so important to me and I need a bit of direction as to what I need to be asking and demanding for and what possibilities there are I may not be aware of. Thank you for any help.

Focal t2 hyperintense nodules within the strap muscles are nonspecific. Consider ultrasound for further evaluation.  Impressions from MRI after the Injection, which is from the ER visit two days ago. 1. No evidence of epidural abscess 2. Posterior disk osteophyte complex at C5-6 with partial effacement of the anterior thecal sac and moderate to left neural foraminal narrowing.  Back to my question...or one of my questions....could the partial effacement of the anterior thecal sac be causing these terrible symptoms? Is there a notable risk that there could be more compression and damage to the thecal sac if I have the blood patch in the thoracic region?

Hs CRP and calcium scoring will not help you much.. if both come out to be positive you would still need an angiogram as an final answer which will add to your anxiety.. if both come as negative, you will still think why u have these palpitations and do i have any coronary artery blocks and again add to your anxiety! so going forward with an angiogram and getting an answer to whether you have  coronary artery disease is what i would go ahead with. also as i said your frequent arrhythmias can be of concern, you must undergo an EP study which can be done in the same sitting with an angiogram. a combined approach with coronary angiohram and EP study can decrease a majority of your concerns. it will give you answers whether you really need stents or ICD, or medical management. my gut feeling is you will do good with medicines.. but still we need to be sure.. please go ahead with an angiogram plus EP study. regarding your query with life expectancy with stents .. peiple with stents have a good life expectancy. stents remain patent for 10-15 years . life expectancy is euwally good with ICDs. you also need a small dose on anti anxiety medications to relieve ur anxiety..

Never smoke/drink/do drugs.  I have been a swimmer, scuba diver, and volleyball player for years.  My mother is 60 and hypertensive; my father is 58 and had a triple angioplasty at 47. Both of my parents live very stressful, sedentary lifestyles, are overweight, and have a history of poor health choices (poor diets, exercise, smoking, etc).  None of my grandparents had a history of heart problems (living into their mid-80's or later...I'm suggesting environment not genetics).  Over the past 10 years I have had an extremely high level of anxiety (spouse blindness, lawsuits, self-employment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc).  About 4 years ago I began having panic attacks off and on for a span of several months.  For the past 2 years I have had palpitations in my chest that I am consciously aware of (to me, they seemed to occur around 5 times a day).  They seem worse when I feel any anxiety-especially when I consciously think about the palpitations...it is as if they scare me into having more of them.  When I was routinely exercising on the ellipticals at the YMCA, as recently as a year ago, it seemed that I had a lower number of these palpitations that I was consciously aware of.  Two FP (family practice) doctors dismissed them as a benign, transient irregular heartbeat, presumed congenital or caffeine induced.  A third doctor sent had me wear a 24-hour Holter monitor.     The Holter monitor showed a 5-beat V-Tach (5 beats at a .10 sec interval).  The timing seemed to correspond with the time I awoke to a brand-new alarm clock that my wife had purchased.  The new alarm literally woke me with a jump. (I can't guarantee that the times were identical, but they were notably close). The Holter monitor also showed a number of transient PVC's.  I should note that for the time I wore the monitor, I basically sat around the house or slept, as I didn't want to cause any problems with the test (and felt reasonably limited wearing the monitor and leads).  I didn't feel any real undue anxiety, but was consciously aware of 4 PVC's during the test.  (I am waiting for the report to show how many I actually had).     The doctor called me on a Sunday morning with the news of the V-Tach and told me to get to the ER at the U/T Medical Center asap as this was potentially life threatening.  (I had worn the Holter from 3 pm Friday to noon or so on Saturday).     At the ER, they took a blood sample (Troponin 0.00%), 2 chest xrays (negative), normal potassium, normal magnesium, normal T3 & T4...basically ruled out metabolic causes, infection, or other disease state.  I was on a 12-lead EKG for about 7 1/2 hours.

I also took the stress test.  It took 9 1/2 minutes of exercise (increasing incline and pace at 3 minute intervals) to get my BP and HR where they wanted them to be.  I stayed on the machine until 10.25 minutes had passed and the tech was satisfied.  (I felt entirely capable of going another 10 minutes, but I had already reached their target rates and I was starting to sweat a bit and breathe heavier...not Heavy, just heavier than normal breathing).  The test registered 4 couplets and a 3 beat V-Tach near the end of the test.  I should note here that my anxiety was also high during the test, as I knew fully why I was being tested and felt grave concern when I was the youngest person in the waiting room by probably 20-25 years.     I was placed on 25 mg of Metoprolol XR and 81 mg of children's aspirin per day.  (I should note that my cholesterol 2 1/2 yrs ago was 157, LDL was 56 and HDL was 39.  I have also used one 14-day course of OTC Prevacid for Reflux in each of the past 2 years, and drink less than 4 cups of coffee/Pepsi per week...typically I drink skim milk or water...I've had no caffeinated drinks in a week now).     The 1st day in the ER, I felt in excess of 300 PVC's.  The EKG alarm kept going off for the PVCs, and every time it went off, my anxiety shot up and I would have several more (I'm having a few now as I write about this!)...they were worst when I first received the phone call telling me to go right to the ER, and again when I was first told that I would probably need an ICD...The next 2 days the number of PVCs was under 100, and then for 3 days it was below 50.  Today (day 6), I would put that number at closer to 20.  I don't know if the medication is doing anything, since I am still well above the number I normally am aware of in a day, but my anxiety about this situation is pretty high.     The cardiologist called and wants to do an angiogram and place stents immediately if he finds any blockages.  He also wants to take all of those results and send them on to an electrophysiologist to see if I am a candidate for an ICD, RF ablation, or medicinal therapy.     A friend, who is an FP, thought it would be best to raise my dose of Metoprolol a bit (to 50 mg), add a low dose of Prozac to keep my anxiety down, and keep me on the aspirin as well.  He also thinks they should do a \\\"calcium scoring\\\" test and an HsCRP (High sensitivity CRP), along with a Lipomed to evaluate the liklihood of my having a blockage without doing an angiogram at this point.  His point was that he thought it better that if the other tests were negative, they should treat me with the meds for a good 4-6 months and then re-test/re-evaluate at that time before running off and doing an angiogram now.  He does think that this entire situation is probably much ado about nothing, and could potentially self-resolve with proper medicinal treatment and good diet and exercise habits.     The FP I am currently seeing (I just relocated to another state, 650 miles from home), as well as the cardiologist, both want me to get the angiogram and stenting as necessary.

The 10-year mortality for patients receiving a stent seems to run about 33%....a very big number in my opinion.     So I want to know: 1) Do the V-Tachs I've described seem terrible? (One of my professors is an FP and he cited a study done in Philadelphia where they strapped Holter monitors on med students for 48 hrs and found that over 80% of them had a minimum of a 4 beat V-tach in that time frame.  Another FP professor suggested that if you put Holter monitors on our entire class of med students before an exam, that at least 1/3 would register V-Tachs. 2) Can anxiety induce PVC's and V-Tachs?   3) Does a medicinal approach with follow up testing seem prudent at this point? 4) Is an angiogram necessary or wise at this point?... 5) If they do an angiogram, can I/should I insist that they do not place any stents? 6) Can you comment on life expectency for stent recipients? 7) Do the calcium scoring and HsCRP tests have diagnostic merit over an angiogram given my other history, signs, and symptoms? 8) If those alternate tests look good, is it fair to skip the angiogram and move on to an electrophysiologist for EP testing and possible RF ablation? 9) Can you comment on the efficacy of RF ablation relative to V-Tachs and PVCs? 10) Can you comment on life expectancy if an ICD is necessary? 11) If an ICD isn't necessary at this time, are there diagnostic criteria I need to be aware of and watching to know when I am at a level of substantially elevated risk? 12) Is there any reasonable chance that the combination of medicinal treatment and (possibly) RF ablation may either eliminate the V-Tachs and PVCs or at least be a successful means of postponing an ICD for another 5-10 years? 13) I saw a presentation by a researcher from UW-Madison that indicated they were having some success regrowing cardiac tissue in MI patients from stem cells that were being taken from the patient themselves.  Is this a potential future cure for V-Tachs (say, within the next 10-20 years)? 14) Is there a chance that years of anxiety has allowed for some level of heart remodeling that makes me more suscptible to an epinephrine surge, and if so is there any chance to undo that change? 15) I am on state-sponsored health care insurance.  Do you have any idea what \\\"level\\\" or type of ICD they would allow?  I understande there are a number of different types.  To that end, is there a brand/model you would recommend and why? 16) If I were your patient, how would you advise me to proceed?  Thank-you in advance for your time and consideration.

I guess the only way that i can really explain how i feel is to start at the very beginning so i hope you all have time. I have no one else to ask and no one else is taking me seriously. So i decided that i would try one more time to talk to someone. Since around the age of 13 i was on paxil, it helped A LOT with anxiety, i never found a need to get off of it until i accidentally found myself pregnant at age 18. When i was at the OBGYN the nurse told me that i could not be on paxil while i was pregnant and that i needed to try Zoloft. I never saw the Dr, i never talked to them or anything, i just discontinued my paxil and i began zoloft. The first few days i didn\u2019t feel too bad, i didn\u2019t feel quite right, but i didn\u2019t feel terrible. Than for the next month almost (give or take) after that i had every bad side effect that i could have imagined. I read the side effects for the zoloft and i had 90% of what was listed. I told the Drs several times that i didn\u2019t feel good and that i didn\u2019t want to try any other pill i just wanted to stop taking all of them. After i stopped taking everything all together i felt like i was having withdrawal. I have not felt good since. I am no longer pregnant... i did have an abortion.. but that is a touchy subject.. but i figured that\u2019s also involved with health so i needed to not leave out any details. It has been about 8 months since i have stopped all together and i still to this day do not feel good, every single day i have this odd headache. It feels like pressure in my head. I still have some of the issues that i developed while taking zoloft, which i was told would go away once i stopped and 8 months later i am still dealing with, such as my ears ringing, constantly. I never had that problem before this. I have had countless problems since zoloft and i have been trying to feel better without resulting back to paxil, i like being able to know that i can live without it, i no longer have panic attacks, and if i do on a rare occasion i can control it. I feel i have no need to go back on to paxil, but my dr pretty much insists that i go back on it because he is convinced the way that i feel now is all because of that. The way that i feel right now is a pressure in my head, mainly in my forehead and in the back of my head. If i press on certain parts of my head its sore as if its a soft spot. I have a chronic sinus infection that i have had to treat on and off the allergy seasons with antibiotics, which make that clear up, and strangely enough make my head feel completely better. Many of the Dr s thought that it was the sinus infections that was making my head feel weird. But i asked them why than would i feel pressure in the back of my head when i have no sinus s there?

Many of the Dr s thought that it was the sinus infections that was making my head feel weird. But i asked them why than would i feel pressure in the back of my head when i have no sinus s there? So that blew that theory out. I have also had bacterial and yeast infections every once in a while that also had to be treated with antibiotics, and again, (no sinus infection issues at the time) my head would feel better. Another example of this was when i had another bacterial or yeast infection of some kind and while i was taking my antibiotic it began to make my head feel better, but before i was done taking them it started to feel weird again... So talking with my nose dr he decided that it would be a bad idea to take anymore antibiotics because he thought that they were treating SOMETHING in my head, but no one knew for sure what that SOMETHING was. But he said that if we kept miss treating it with antibiotics than it would soon become immune to them. So since then i have refused to take another antibiotic because i do not want to make anything any worse, but the problem is we have made ZERO progress on what is actually wrong, i have spent over 500 dollars trying to find out what exactly is wrong and we have gotten no where. I began to get worried and i asked for an MRI, and a CT scan, apparently they both came back normal, but i had no one read them to me or go over what exactly there was... but they did assure me that i had no tumor or anything. So that helped reassure me for the time being. I have had multiple blood tests for many different things and they assure me that i have no infections or anything, (which confuses me, because if i have a chronic sinus infection.. shouldn\u2019t that show up?..) but either way they assure me that there is no infection. So i am feeling like i am on my own. I have done research trying to find something, anything that could give the same kind of symptoms of what i am feeling, and i stumbled across meningitis. Now i understand that meningitis is usually severe and can do damage in as little as one day... but i have also found and i will quote it exactly as i found it Occasionally, if someone has been on antibiotics for another infection, the symptoms can take longer to develop or may be less intense my source is from WEBMD. Meningitis can also be caused by the spread of an infection occurring near the brain, such as from the ears or the sinuses. It is also an occasional complication of brain, head, or neck surgery. which i was thinking could have something to do with my sinus infection ( which i now have AGAIN, but cant treat because i cant take antibiotics until we find out what is wrong with my head and why it feels better with antibiotics). I have tried talking to 3 different doctors. My primary, My ear nose and throat doctor, and they both ended up sending me to another doctor... which i cant quite remember who or what he is suppose to do.. but all i remember is him being extremely rude and ignored anything and everything that i had to say.. so i got absolutely no where with him. I left his office in tears and had to pay 80 or more dollars just to be in the same exact spot I\u2019ve been in for months. I have had blood work done and many other things done, i asked my primary doctor out of desperation and last measures to see if i could get a spinal tap to make absolutely sure that it was not meningitis. I am exhausting every option, i am running out of money and i am desperately searching for an answer. I am 19 years old and i have no idea what is wrong with me, it is effecting my everyday life and i have spent so much time, energy and money into figuring out the possible cause of what is going on. I feel like no one is taking me seriously now because my primary doctor has just suggested that i try taking my paxil again.", "start_char_idx": 93855, "end_char_idx": 98211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c77598c-de07-4786-ace3-3e07871c3a34": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c77598c-de07-4786-ace3-3e07871c3a34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf3e377b-cde9-4a55-af41-308e6752ef1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "bf2032ac32bec9fe88c1d3e967572736ae6027e2eccf519b2735984306c3d7ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eac2b155-b5e3-4401-aed8-1a0f1de6e474", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cef0a0617d8e6c8eede1f936edcb68999cca9f78069135ab34878b909f497dc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I left his office in tears and had to pay 80 or more dollars just to be in the same exact spot I\u2019ve been in for months.

I feel like no one is taking me seriously now because my primary doctor has just suggested that i try taking my paxil again. Its very frustrating because i feel like no one takes me seriously once they learn that i have anxiety and they assume that it is all in my head or just taking a simple pill with help make everything better. It just seems like whatever it is, is getting worse, and i would really appreciate help from anyone that is willing to help. I have not taken antibiotics in many months and i feel like my head just keeps getting worse. I don\u2019t know how to explain it... i have been told that it could be cluster headaches... but i have had headaches, i have had migraines.. they are nothing like this. It is a constant, all day everyday, from the second that i wake up to the minute before i fall asleep the same feeling. Lately i have felt extremely tired, my eyes have started to hurt.. i had to go to the eye dr because my vision has been doing weird things, but they said that i have perfect vision and the only problem i have is i have hard corneas.. or whatever that is that causes you to have higher pressure in your eyes without having glaucoma. I have been noticing trails, i see halos around objects mostly people, i see something that i would consider visual static.. and this has all started just recently.. about maybe a month its been happening and getting worse. At first i could see visual static and maybe every once in a while i would see trails, than i started to see halos. I try to ignore it, because i don\u2019t have enough money to go in for a check up any more, i don\u2019t know whets wrong so i don\u2019t know how to have anyone fix it. The reason that i decided to write to you today and not try to ignore it like i do every other day is because i was in the shower today and out of no where i felt like i was going to pass out, i felt this weird sensation that the room was just getting dark and i was just going to pass out, so i jumped out of the shower and sat on the floor for a minute. I had this stabbing pain in my back and my stomach and i felt like i was going to puke, when i felt as if i could stand i did so, and i left the room to get some fresh air, immediately i felt as if i was going to puke again and i ran into the bathroom and i had one dry heave... and felt completely normal again. That is the first time anything like that has ever happened to me before. So please, i am completely lost on what to do. All i want to know is how do i find out what could be wrong with how my head feels. What could be causing it, why does it feel better with antibiotics and what can i do. Please if you have any words of advice please let me know. I am sorry for such a long note but i am running out of people to talk to. Please and thank you.

Good day! I read your concerns thoroughly and will break down all your problems systematically--1. tailbone pain --anatomically, the rectum (lower colon), is directly sitting on the tailbone.  Any inflammation in that area can cause discomfort or pain in the lower back, especially the tailbone (sacrum).  However, there is also a possibility that it is a separate problem, since previously you have had lower back pains.  Lower back pains can be caused by several problems-- most common is musculo-skeletal strain, other causes are kidney stones, urinary tract infection, slipped disc, scoliosis, impinged nerve.  The best diagnostic to rule out spinal bone problems in your lower back is a plain Xray of the Lumbo-sacral area (AP-Lateral views), an MRI might follow if with problem noted in the Xray.  2.  For your rectal pain, since it was already documented on your CT scan that there is thickening in the area, a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy will give us a direct visualization of the problem, a biopsy of the inflamed/thickened area might also be a good idea to know the cause-- whether infectious, inflammatory bowel, auto immune, or cancer.  3. Diarrhea/constipation/bloating -- this problem is probably caused by the thickening of your bowels.  The main diagnostic that can give us an idea of what is the underlying cause will be the sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy.4.  Sluggishness might be a symptom of dehydration secondary to your diarrhea.  I suggest you take in a lot of fluids, especially after an loose stool episode, to replenish the losses.I hope I was able to answer your concerns.

Also, I have had changing bowel conditions that are obviously not normal for me... ranging from what seems like constipation (albeit I went several times per day but the effort was not norm, also sometimes it felt like I had to have a bowel movement and couldn t) to current loose stool and diarrhea. It feels like the issue (pain) is coming from the bowels. So, I have been to the doctor (GP x 4, ER x 3) numerous times over the past few weeks so I will share the process so as to give you an idea where we are at. At this point (as of today), after you review the details below, I am waiting to go to a GI specialist however my condition is such that I am starting to really worry that each day I delay further treatment I am causing more damage to my body (condition and generally feeling of good health deteriorating)\u2026 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 weeks ago I visit GP for what appeared to be dark urine and or cloudy (vs. normal).

Due to other visits to GP and ER in notes below I have had another 3 urine tests all clear (3 of the tests were just dips and 3 were sent for microscopic tests) 3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to visit in item # 1 sent for ultrasound of abdominal and chest x-ray (checked all organs except bowel and pancreas). All clear on both tests. 4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Urine issue cleared up without any treatment. Increased my fluid intake overall so this may be the corrective action. There was discussion with GP that I had kidney stones but none found. 5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pain started to build across back (kidney area, I suppose) over several days and became somewhat unbearable.", "start_char_idx": 110694, "end_char_idx": 114952, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b382d7d-f2dc-4d34-a8c5-e17cea814378": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b382d7d-f2dc-4d34-a8c5-e17cea814378", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd392255-cdec-47c3-88ca-7be4a9b6e5c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "17cbe6074d406f7f1d25482a5bb91cb4d2178c45ab9efa1ea830ea435618dfe7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c211ffc5-76bc-46e6-ae90-b14a8ec989e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4948f55e495e14374932810b01b16f668b1bf8ebc727be3791db1cd300644ff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1st came back with more blood red cells than normal (just barely over the 0-3 count considered normal as per GP discussion).Two additional tests (one each day for 2 consecutive days) all clear for red blood cells.

Pain moved around back and sometimes was higher in back and very painful (different days = pain in different locations). Visited GP again and was given pain pills as it was stated that due to the tests done so far it would not be normal to investigate any further. I was sent to physio stating that a back issue could be present. Physio confirmed there was no evidence there were any issues with my back causing bowel issues (stated it was likely the other way around). They stated I had some posture issues which they could help with but were unrelated to my acute issues. 6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the interim, while not prescribe by my doctor, I took some muscle relaxer (Robax Platinum) so I could function. Pills did relieve back pain. After 2 days or so taking well below the max dose allowed on package I became very weak, pale and had dropped heart rate (happened after dinner one evening). Went to ER and was put on EKG and had urine test. At visit to ER I have been off the robax for 12+ hours and ER doctor said vitals ok and the pills likely caused the problem (so, I never took another one). 7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visited GP the next day she did some more blood tests which were clear (I know CBC but not sure what else was checked). 8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pain increased over 2 days and at 11pm one night the stabbing pain in rectal/tailbone area was so back I went to the ER (could not sleep). I had a digital rectal exam done and was clear. Doctors were at a loss as to what was wrong and sent me home. I believe my age, being only 34, is impacting their decision. 9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I returned to my GP the next day who sent me for an x-ray of tailbone which was clear. 10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER the following morning after another night of unbearable pain) and the ER doctor stated I likely had acute case of diviculitis and prescribed antibiotics (2 of them, taken together, for 7 days). I was also sent for a CT scan in 64-slice scanner and put through with and without contrast (IV). After reviewing the CT scan doctor reaffirmed it was diviculitis and stated \u201cthere isn\u2019t a whole lot going on down there\u201d (official report was non-specific inflammation) and said the drugs would wipe out any bug causing problems (albeit he still confirmed diviculistis on official report). They noticed some inflammation of lower colon and rectum but stated not significant. 11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the antibiotics given the pain went away and I felt ok (although a bit lightheaded and nauseous \u2013 noted on documentation that this is side effect of pills). Also, while bowel movements had now close to the correct form they were very loosely formed. Also, the stool was close to black (not quite, but dark). Since this went away after finished drugs, and my reading side effects info on this drugs, I assume it was the pills and this did not alarm me. 12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that the drugs are done the pain is coming back, but it is nowhere near where it was prior to taking the pills. 13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was called by my GP a few days ago who wanted to follow-up on CT scan.

She stated that there was wall thickening and/or inflammation possibly showing a bit near the other end of colon (starting end) as well as the rectum/lower colon as stated by the ER doctor who ordered the CT. She stated further investigation required (required protocol). She was not convinced it is diviculitis. She also mentioned something about lymph nodes irritation by inflammation/wall thickening at the starting end of colon and mentioned this was more common with Crohn s disease but didn\u2019t think I had this since this had come on somewhat suddenly. She stated that the CT report only stated \u201cthere may be\u201d something showing on the starting end of colon (meaning there wasn\u2019t much showing but there could be something, as my GP put it). Blood tests sent in to check for inflammation (I have not heard back). I was called 3 days after GP visit by nurse who stated I have been referred to GI doctor and they advised them (where I am being sent) it is urgent. When I questioned the \u201curgent\u201d statement by the nurse and asked if something serious was now considered she stated \u201cno, nothing like that\u201d (same thing GP told me) . As I type this message I am sitting here with mild rectal/tailbone pain, recent onset of bloating (not severe or painful but noticeable \u2013 this is a new issue within the last 36 hours or so), back pain (lower and mid). Diarrhea has been issue for 2 days now along with some light coloured stools that are nor formed whatsoever (along with gas). I also feel quite sluggish (although not exhausted) and warm (mild sweaty feeling) but numerous checks for fever (home test) are negative (as have all checks at ER over the past several weeks). Unfortunately, it is true we start to really worry when it comes to our health and can over-think things. Having said that, I know something is definitely wrong and I\u2019m curious if there is more action I should be taking immediately. There is much discussion online regarding cancer and that is obviously scary for a 34 year old that, up to now, has been quite health (6\u20190\u2019 185lbs). As a side note I am still able to do my evening run of 3.5km on nights when the discomfort isn\u2019t too bad (went last night and will go tonight). I could not do any running prior to the antibiotics due to pain. Pain seems to be gone during the exercise (or due to all the work my body is doing to run it over-rides the pain, I am not sure how that works). I usually get in 3 runs per week in the evening. Any feedback on what I should be doing to get myself back to good health would be much appreciated.\",\n        \"email\": \"jzvsqw@gmail.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"6876069397\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 229873,\n        \"Description\": \"What causes random heart palpitations?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  To begin with, I think you are a highly intelligent person.  You have presented the most complete accounting of your child's history than any other parent I have seen since starting work with 'Ask A Doctor.'  This is a great aid to me.  Thank you.     The anti-seizure medication your daughter's neurologist(I hope this doctor is a pediatric neurologist) is one that is often given to pediatric patients.  To be effective in controlling seizures, anti-seizure medicines must obtain a certain level in the blood.  (Levels are different for each medicine.)

Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Dear Sir/Madam, My daughter Ananya has been diagnosed with Simple Focal Seizures. I want help in this regard Her Date of Birth is 15th Mar 2013, Age: 4.5 Years, Weight: 15.5 Kilograms FIRST ATTACK: The first attack happened on 27.07.17 morning @ 5:30 am, my daughter 4.5 year old suddenly started crying in sleep and was yelling that something was happening to her leg, when I checked immediately, her left leg was shaking. Immediately I massaged her leg and make her stand but she was not able to stand and her legs were loose and she was not able to control her leg movements. Later I make her sit on stool and massaged her leg after that she was ok and was playing actively as usual. Later seeing her active I went to office at 7:40am on that day. This episode lasted 1.5 minutes & she was conscious during this period. When I was in office my wife called me at 8:15am again said her leg was again paining & jerking, her left leg became hard and she fell down shaking her left leg and body. She has massaged her leg and within 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1.5 minute she was again normal playing as usual. I came and took her to local pediatrician who has said that it may be due to calcium deficiency and prescribed calcium syrup. Again after coming back from doctor while she was playing again her left leg muscles became stiff and again her left leg was shaking at 11:30 am. Again the same has repeated at 3:00 PM. We have rushed to our regular family pediatrician on that day at by 6:00 PM and at 6:15 PM at his table the same has repeated. On seeing her doctor has said that she is having Simple Focal Seizures and she was admitted to the Hospital HOSPITALIZATION: Immediately we rushed her to Hospital by 27.07.17 evening 8 PM, she was kept on Anti-convulsion IV Fluids and a series of tests have been done on her. Next day all test results were reviewed by Pediatric Neurologist and she said that all other reports were normal but need to start LEVIPIL Syrup (Composition: Levetiracetam -100mg/ml) as she got that many attacks on one single day, They have suggested to use 2ml Levipil twice per day with Multi Vitamin Syrups and was discharged. (I have attached Test Reports during Hospitalization) Next Attack: Later after discharge since she was absolutely OK, I have not started Levipil and have given Multi Vitamins only. On 31.07.17 at 9:43 AM again she got the attack similarly her left leg muscles became stiff and her left leg was shaking, she was totally conscious and was responding to all the commands given by us. Immediately we have called our Pediatric Neurologist and she asked us to start 2 ml Levipil immediately. Later after starting the same the Seizure attacks were stopped. On 09.09.17 (40 Days After starting the medicine) Again on this day 09.09.17 at 5:30 PM similar attack has happened, Her left leg became stiff and was shaking. She was conscious during this period. What has happened on this day was, I forgot to give medicine on morning. The dose was delayed by 3 Hrs in the morning. Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested not to miss the dose and we will increase the dose if it seizure repeats only. Later we have made sure that she gets the medicine correctly and later the seizures had stopped.", "start_char_idx": 130684, "end_char_idx": 134903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e425275-aef4-47c7-8abb-5ce18828e48f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e425275-aef4-47c7-8abb-5ce18828e48f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3cdbff0-ed40-438f-8f16-c1aa17f5c987", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "4e98c742d67f09330826ca1aeec17d5d78c7a4bd60749d1c543a51ceec826ee7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed5a4fdc-b122-49fb-97ce-e735022466ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5966e573d9d7341825a2e31a60807fe015cf9f4f77609b8351cf2539f872105", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Immediately we have called our Pediatric Neurologist and she asked us to start 2 ml Levipil immediately.

Later we have made sure that she gets the medicine correctly and later the seizures had stopped. So we were continuing the same dose of 2ml Levipil twice per day and maintained timings strictly On 26.10.17 (46 Days after Previous Attack) Despite adhering to strict timing in medicine dose on 26th Oct \u00e2\u0080\u009917 at 5:00 PM, she has got similar attack immediately when she came back from school. Her left leg became stiff and was shaking, she was conscious during this period and responding to all commands given by us. Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested to increase Levipil Dose from 2 ml to 3 ml twice per day. Since she was going through exams in the school, I thought that this was due to stress of exams and I have increased the dose from 2ml to 2.5 ml twice per day, and later she was OK.

Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested to continue 3 ml twice per day, till next 5 days as it will take some time to settle and we will wait for the dose to work, and she said that if the dosage is not working we will increase to 3.5ml twice per day. On 31.10.17 at 7:40 PM (Within 12 Hrs after Previous Attack) Again similar attack came in the evening at 7:40 PM with same 30-40 Sec duration, as suggested we have continued 3 ml twice per day dosage On 01.11.17 at 8:30 AM (Within 13 Hrs after Previous Attack) Again similar attack came in the morning at 8:30 AM with same 30-40 Sec duration, as suggested we are continuing 3 ml twice per day dosage On 01.11.17 Evening, I have increased the dosage of Levipil from 3ml to 3.5ml Twice per day On 03.11.17 Morning at 8:45 AM again she has got similar attack As per Doctor advice, not increased the dose further and kept at 3.5 ml only From last one week (26.10.17) she has got 5 attacks and the duration between attacks is gradually reducing, I am very much worried on the condition of my daughter, please guide me what to do.

If any of the medicine does get on your hand, rinse the area right away with a lot of clear water. Do not use soap or other cleansers.Be careful not to tear the patch or make any holes in it. Damage to a patch may allow fentanyl to pass into your skin too quickly. This can cause an overdose.Apply the patch to a dry, flat skin area on your upper arm, chest, or back. Choose a place where the skin is not very oily and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or irritation. Do not apply this medicine to areas that have received radiation therapy.The patch will stay in place better if it is applied to an area with little or no hair. If you need to apply the patch to a hairy area, you may first clip the hair with scissors, but do not shave it off.If you need to clean the area before applying the medicine, use only plain water. Do not use soaps, other cleansers, lotions, or anything that contains oils or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.Remove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand, for a minimum of 30 seconds. Make sure that the entire adhesive surface is attached to your skin, especially around the edges.If the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape.If the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.If you need to apply more than 1 patch at a time, place the patches far enough apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap each other.Wash your hands with a lot of clear water after applying the medicine. Do not use soap or other cleansers.Remove the patch after 3 days (72 hours), or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch. If possible, use a place on the other side of your body. Wait at least 3 days before using the first area again.In young children or persons with decreased mental alertness, the Duragesic\u00ae patch should be put on the upper back to decrease the chance that the patch will be removed and placed in the mouth.After a Duragesic\u00ae patch is applied, fentanyl passes into the skin a little at a time. A certain amount of the medicine must build up in the skin before it is absorbed into the body. Up to a full day (24 hours) may pass before the first dose begins to work. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose during the first few weeks before finding the amount that works best for you.

He also has SVC syndrome with the SVC being 95% occluded. His left arm and chest were greatly swollen with swelling in both legs as well, but less severe than in his left chest and arm. He was given one round of chemo using the R-CHOP, but in less than 48 hours he started feeling a tightness and pain in his left chest. He was given pain medicine and a CT was done. Cardiologist, Pulmonologist, and Radiologist were consulted. Multiple PEs were found in the lungs and a DVT was found near his left ankle. Previous testing before R-CHOP showed heart to have no problems. After chemo, PEs, and DVT, testing showed right side of his heart was enlarged due to PEs, entire body, including face swelled tremendously -- his face was unrecognizable for several days. Doctor started heparin for PEs and DVT. Also, his neck became swollen and had what we called a doughnut around it -- it eventually resolved along with the choking sensation. Within a day or two of the heparin being started, he developed a bleed in his back, near T-10 -- as if the pain in his chest went straight through to his back. This caused him tremendous pain.

The doctor said he did not think that would be a problem, but that if it did, he would give zinecard to avoid muscle damage. The morning following the second round of chemo (a Sunday), my husband had a severe burning pain in his back (he was still on pain meds due to the pain in his chest) and he felt and we could see a huge mass in his left lower back that was very warm to the touch. Dr. on call said zinecard would not be helpful and refused to give it and only authorized increased frequency of pain medicine. This, of course, did nothing for shrinking the mass and did little for the pain. The blood began tracking down his back and a new bleed started down low, just above his backside crack and then began spreading below that onto his bottom. His entire lower back was black, blue, and deep red and then it started tracking to both sides. He felt like he was on fire. Nothing else was being done for him. We were horrified and aghast and no one had any answers for us, but they wanted to do chemo again in two weeks. Needless to say, my husband was NOT agreeable to that as he feared he would bleed again. His red blood count numbers dropped to 6.4 and 18. In the hospital, we put large hospital ice packs on his back and sides -- it took 12 of them and we had to keep refilling them about every 5 to 6 hours. The cold would bring on muscle spasms, so he was given a muscle relaxer as well. That was 6 weeks ago -- the mass in his back is still the same size and my husband is still in terrible pain. Some of the swelling has gone down in his left arm and chest and tremendously in his feet and legs. He has not received any other treatment and the doctors seem to have no clue as to what caused the bleed in his back or how to proceed. After the second round of chemo, we were told that the tumor shrunk by 30% and that the SVC had opened up some, but no one knows why he is still swollen or why the huge hematoma is not resolving. The tracked blood in his back has mostly resolved, but the area is darkened where the blood had been. The lung has created new pathways through the PEs and there is no word on the DVT. After 32 days in the hospital, my husband was released and is still on large doses of pain medicine, Zofran, and Lovenox. He is nauseated, in terrible pain, and is not eating. Four weeks ago, his blood tests showed that he has low protein and low albumen. Nothing is being done about this and my husband now has hanging skin from losing too much weight too quickly. I have brought this to the doctor s attention several times, but he has done nothing about it. My husband has dropped almost 30 kg in 2 months and the doctor has not adjusted his Lovenox dose, which is weight based, and he has not even gotten a weight on him. Our last visit was 3 weeks ago. My husband lies in bed all day feeling sick and in pain. He was once a very strong man who endured lots of pain without a word of complaint. In 30 years of knowing him, he used pain medicine only when his wisdom tooth was extracted years ago and when he broke his RIGHT (NOT LEFT) ankle 25 years ago. He says that it is a burning, searing pain in his back and he and I believe that the chemo is in his muscle and affecting his nerves as well.

The doctor now wants him to do radiation and we have an appointment scheduled for Thursday with the Radiation Oncologist. I doubt that he will even be able to get out of bed to get there. For the last 2 weeks, he has become incredibly nauseated and for no apparent reason, he has started losing his hair again -- it is all over his pillow. This seems to us to indicate that he still has that chemo sitting in his body. He also has lost all of the hair under his left arm (which is the side that is still quite swollen). His bowel became impacted last week and our doctor told us to go to the ER and said that my husband would get a neuro work-up while he was there. He indicated that my husband would be admitted because he asked us to go to a different hospital than the one we wanted to go to because he preferred the Oncology service there -- there is no Oncology in the ER, only on the Oncology/Hematology floor of the hospital. After spending 15 hours in the ER with no water given to my husband (even though I had requested that the nurse give him some as he could not urinate for them to test it and he was losing a ton of fluid through his bowel), the ER released him with only running an MRI, but he was NOT admitted nor was any neuro testing such as a nerve-conduction study done or recommended. My husband was taken out of our vehicle when we arrived at the ER directly onto a bed because he is so incredibley weak and wasted. We were told that the MRI showed no change and I asked no change from what because my husband had never had an MRI before. The nurse could not answer the question. My husband now has no control over his bowel --his stools are liquid and just runs out of him. He is wearing diapers to be on the safe side. We fear that the chemo has damaged his bowel, which we wonder is what maybe caused the impaction in the first place. He has lost all sensation in his left arm, hand, and fingers and his chest and arm are still swollen on that side. He has lost the sensation in his right arm, hand and 3 fingers on his right hand. He has lost sensation in both of his legs and feet. He feels numb and has tingling sensations in all arms, hands, legs, and feet. We feel he is becoming permantently paralyzed. We also fear him getting radiation because we do not know if he still has chemo agents still in that swollen mass and muscle in his back. Is it safe to have radiation if chemo is still in the body? Is radiation 5 days a week for 5 weeks straight safe or usual? Also, since chemo was injected directly into his vein and was carried through the blood and the bleed in his back restarted within hours of the second round of chemo and chemo was still in his blood, can you please explain why the doctor insists that there was no chemo leaking into my husband s back? Does it somehow magically disappear? We fear that my husband has been chemically burned on the inside and that his muscles and nerves and maybe tissues have been and are still being destroyed by the chemo. Is there anyway to get that stuff out of his back at this point? Is there an expert out there that can help us? We are so DESPERATE!! He needs to be seen by someone who can help him!! He feels like he is slowly dying. PLEASE, PLEASE HELP US!! We still have children at home and we do NOT want them growing up without a Daddy (like both of us had to).

I started having back issues and pain. This ended up in the middle of a law suite between the car insurance companies. I had to see the lawyers doctors. Lawyers doctors was a Nuero surgeon and another was a chiropractor. They done X-rays and MRI s. They confirmed I had disk disease, arthritis, scoleous, and some buldging disk and bone spurs. They MRI and X-rayed my whole spine. I also seen my primary doctor too. She also did the same test the lawyers doctors did. She also confirmed all the same results the lawyers doctors had. My primary care doctor had another doctor look at it as a second opinion. She at first thought from the first set of X-rays that I had spinal cancer and wanted a second opinion on it. That other doctor she got the second opinion from confirmed that it was just really bad disk disease and arthritis and scoleous and suggested that she have a MRI done on me. I have had a MRI and x-rays done in September 2010 and then again in 2012 of both thoracic spine and lumbar basically my whole spine order by my primary care doctor. My X-rays and MRI s at that time shown a few bulging disk, scoleous, degenerative disk disease and arthritis and bone spurs of the spine. X-rays my primary doctor done in 2010 shown the disk disease and arthritis to be pretty bad along with the MRI in 2010 and 2012. The MRI report in 2012 stated I had disk disease, arthritis, bulging disk, bone spurs, and scoleous. In 2012 after my MRI my primary referred me to a pain management specialist. The pain management doctor has been seeing and treating my issues with pain controll. The pain management doctor also reffered me to a pain clinic for injections and epiderals. The doctor at that pain clinic reviewed my MRI and X-rays and he attempted a epideral that he did himself using X-Ray and he also had my MRI pulled up. He at that time stated he didn t think the epideral would work that I had a lot of disk disease, arthritis, scoleous, and bone spurs that he was also having issues getting the epideral needle up through my spine. They put me on nueroton and refused to do any more epiderals and I have continued to see pain management. My primary care doctor I had been seeing left that practice and went back home to India. So I started seeing another primary care doctor in that same group and still seeing my pain management doctor that my first primary care doctor sent me to. Here recently my legs have started throbbing and going numb and my lower spine throbs. My legs feel week and heavy. They shake when going up and down stairs. I m a nursing assistant and have been for years on my feet and legs for 12hrs a day for the last 14 years. Didn t start having issues with the legs and feet till this last few months. Blood labs have been done and have shown to be normal. This new primary care doctor that s in the same group as my first one who started diagnosing these issues l went and seen him a month ago about the leg issues. He ordered just a lumbar MRI with out contrast. When the results came in he stated I had L5 and L4 that were slightly bulging and alot of nerve inflammation in that area. This primary care doctor asked me if I wanted to go to another pain clinic or see neuro surgery. I chose to go see Nuero surgery. I have been to the pain clinics and had no relief I have continued to feel worse. I seen the nurse practitioner at the Nuero surgeons office who just reviewed the recent lumbar MRI and not the full MRI that was done in 2012 of my whole spine.

Heart failure usually develops slowly after a heart damage, caused by a heart attack, excessive heart fatigue after years of untreated hypertension or valvulopathy. Symptoms of heart failure are not always obvious. In the early stages of heart failure, some people have no symptoms. Others may present symptoms such as fatigue or breathing difficulty due to old age. But sometimes the symptoms of heart failure are more obvious. Due to the inability of the heart to effectively feed your organs (such as the kidneys and the brain), you may experience a number of symptoms, such as: A breathing difficulty, swelling of the feet and legs, Lack of energy, feeling tired, sleeping difficulty at night due to breathing problems, swelling of the abdomen, loss of appetite. Some people are more likely than others to develop heart failure. No one can predict who will develop it, but there are known risk factors. Knowing the risk factors and consulting a doctor for early treatment is a good strategy for managing heart failure. Risk Factors for Heart Failure are: Hypertension, Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction), Valvar Abnormalities, Cardiomyopathy, Family History of Heart Failure, Diabetes. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, limit salt intake, lose weight or reduce stress levels. These changes can help alleviate some of the symptoms of heart failure and decrease the fatigue of your heart. Many medications are used to treat heart failure. Your doctor may prescribe ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, and diuretics, among others. Generally, a combination of drugs is used. May be that the implantation of a cardiac device called a cardiac resynchronization device is indicated for you. It sends tiny electrical pulses to the lower chambers of your heart to help them beat in a more coordinated or \\\"synchronized\\\" way. This can help improve the pumping efficiency of the heart. Some people feel the need to meet other patients.

Some people feel the need to meet other patients. Hospitals, health centers and local newspapers can provide information on patient associations or associations for the caregivers. During palliative care in heart failure three components are essential: palliative medical treatment of heart failure, education of the patient and his family, accompaniment by the doctor and the caregivers.During Palliative medical treatment two points are necessary to emphasize:- Optimal use of combination therapy: diuretics + IEC + beta blocker and ivabradine + spironolactone and / or ARAII, each stage of which reduces the death rate under optimal conditions of use by 30% (studies MERIT-HF, TRACE, SOLVD and SHIFT), insofar as it does not aggravate the patient's discomfort by hypotension, hyponatremia, bradycardia or asthenia.- The value of cardiological follow-up. Indeed, regardless of the stage of heart failure, adherence to treatment and patient education divide morbi-mortality by 2, according to the Mahler multicenter study. This emphasizes the importance of effective follow-up in the networking of a doctor-treating physician-cardiologist network. The education of the cardiac insufficiency is fundamental, because the patient must understand his treatment to grasp the importance of each medication; It should also be informed of the potential side effects of each therapeutic class, and the purchase of a quality scales and cuff tensiometer is necessary for home follow-up. At all stages of heart failure, physical activity is theoretically a necessary complement, but it will be gradually decreased, depending on the patient's exhaustion (reduced stair climbing, walking in a corridor, gymnastics, sometimes simple movements repeated in the chair or the bed, without objective performance).Relationships with the family are essential at this stage Sometimes it is the partner alone who ensures a watchful eye and participates in the monitoring of dyspnea and edema. It must be informed about the severity of the illness without worrying about it, train it in the monitoring of anticoagulant treatments, the use of nitrates or diuretics and the adaptation of a balanced diet and, stable as to the amount of salt. It must acquire a certain knowledge, the doctor and the care team being of course the guarantors of this learning, which must be adapted to each person, to each couple, according to the knowledge and the anxiety of each one. It is difficult to give a schema that will have to be adapted to the patient's sensitivity and to the experience of the disease. This participation of the entourage is fundamental, especially during outbreaks of heart failure. It makes possible treatments that the patient could no longer provide alone. It makes it possible to mobilize it, to ensure a hygiene of life and a dietetic which it is impossible to guarantee in the isolated patient. Rehabilitation, which could, before this palliative period, of course be carried out in specialized centers, is rather deleterious and exhausting in this context. It is at this stage that palliative care takes its place, but the mere evocation comes at first to offset the patient's vision of the long course of his illness sustained by the unrelenting hope of a prolonged life. The illusion of the omnipotence and endless mastery of this fragile heart is brutally thwarted by the reality of the patient's exhaustion and permanent dyspnea, and by the aggravation of edema. The work in collaboration with the generalist is essential here: adjustment of strategies and consistency of discourse, in order not to induce contradictions or misunderstandings.

After surgery I started to gain weight and when I was 11 I started having my period. After my first, 6 weeks later I got punched in the stomach and started my period again. When I was 14 I started to walk and exercise a lot so much that my periods stopped coming for 4 months. I was at a healthy 140 pounds till when I was 16 and I started working 35 plus hours a week, getting good grades in school, and started dating. I became sexually active at 16 as well. The first time I had sex I did not bleed at all. All the while my periods were very irregular coming ever 4-8 weeks. I contributed this to stress. I got put on the depo shot at 17 and gained 35 pounds fast (in about 3 months). I did not go back and get another shot or get put on any other birth control. I was still seeing the same man (who is now my husband). Over the years I just keep gaining pound after pound. I stopped exercising when I got a job because I never had the time. I quit that job when I was 17 and just focused on school (my grades dropped to a B/C average). To tell you the truth I never monitored my menstrual cycles the way that I should. I do keep a lot of stress in my life and always have and everyone always told me that that is why my periods are the way that they are. I split from my boyfriend after high school and was sexually active with two other men one of which I used protection (condoms) and the other I didn t. I was living with my sister and our cycles seemed to start becoming regular together. She was trying to get pregnant and one time she told me she got her period and I thought it was odd that I had not gotten mine. So I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. What my sister thought was her period later she found out was implantation bleeding (She had a sucessful birth to a beautiful little girl). I started my period two weeks later. I actually went back to the boyfriend that I had had since I was 16 and got married a couple months later at age 18. I kept a lot of stress then because we were on our own and not really doing as well as I would hoped. We did not eat regular at all and I was under a lot of stress. But despite that my periods came about every 6 or so weeks. I thought was normal. I went for a pap in 06 and got put on the pill 10 months later (me and my husband always used protection everytime) My pap was normal I did not have any diseases or anything. My periods always came during the sugar pill week (it usually took 2 or 3 days) but they came and ended either before, on, or after the day I went back on the actual pill. I went back for another pap in 07 a year later everything came back normal my periods were still doing what was stated above. The next year I went for a pap in 08 and told them I may have a yeast infection and the prescribed Diflucan (which I was allergic to). Within a week I got a call that I had Trichomoniasis? I think that is how you spell it? Anyways it was very odd because I had no other sex partners and to tell you the truth I can almost gaurantee my husband did not have any either. I went got a prescription filled it and me and my husband took it as prescribed. I was also put on effexor XR for depression that year by another doctor.. They also changed my pill that year as well. I can honestly say that the changed it from a combination pill to just a one hormonal pill (or maybe the other way around) I am sorry I can not remember the name. The next year (n 09) I back I had gotten up to 240 pounds, I had headaches everyday for a year, and was taking a lot of tylenol. The took me off the birth control they though it was too much.

Well that is when me and my husband decided that it was time to try for a baby. I started doing a high fiber, no eating after 7, no pop, lot of water diet. It worked great. But because of family issues (sister was now a drug addict) I had to start taking care of my neice and stayed with my mom a couple days out of the week. Sress levels became very high. I went to a therapist when I stopped taking the effexor medication and the decided to put me on Lamictal which within 3 months they had to replace with seraquel. That only lasted 2 weeks. I slept all the time and I could not care for my neice. All the while after being taken off of birth control me and my husband had been trying to conceive. My periods were every 2 months now. I kept taking HPT and they were always negative. So I actually gave up hope. We talked about quitting but when the time came to put a condom on we never did. In October of 09 My sister had gotten into a lot of trouble. Me and her had some words and then she left. Well my husband was actually going to get a pregnancy test on his way home that night because he had noticed some changes in me ? I dont know his words not mine LOL. Well I tried to relax and rest when I got a horrible sharp pain in my back (I never used to get sharp pains before my period not like this) and almost started immediatly. I called my husband and told him to not worry about bringing home a test because I had started my period. I bled for 10 days. I never bled for anything over 5 days before. I also had a lot of stringy blood but never passed anything. Within a month I started getting lower left abdominal pains that would go into my back and down my leg. I had started going to school online and I thought well this is because I am at the computer all the time. Well it was now November and I got a double ear infection and strep throat. I was prescribed amox/clav 800 mg. They did not do a pregnancy test because I told them there was no way I was pregnant. (me and my husband actually had stopped having sex since the incident). Well me and my husband had a very great conversation and started trying again at the begining of December. I was laid up for a week while I had the infection and finished my antibiotics. My hip pain kept coming. Judging by a different pain in my abdominal area and the discharge I was having December the 23 we immediatley had sex. I also had a mild cold for 3 days all through Christmas then. I was for sure to have orgasms afterwards (to help the sperm) every time we had sex. Well when I realized I had not had my pap I made an appointment January 4th. I took 3 pregnancy tests and they all came back negative. I went to the appointment as schelduled and got a pap where she was having trouble reaching my cervix. She said it was pointing down? I dont know what that means?

conditions most of my life since around 9 that I can remember mainly chronic depprression & anxity, until I started to get older when my mental health slowly but surely started to decline very rapidly, with all of the things I had already indured starting from a very young age of a child, born to both abusive drugies & alcoholic s majoirly at the time and most of my young adult life as well

my younger yrs. while my parents partied!!!...

I get $387.00, and then just $200.00 in food stamps, I have no license & i have no car, And remember i am extremlly sick around 95% of the time and am unable to even leave the house by myself, and as of now i have 3 different doctors i have to see each of them once a month and 1 of them is 4 hrs out of town just to get my monthley meds from eac one every single month, and i live in a small town so there is no local trainspertation here, so i struggle continuesly every single months to find a ride to go to just 2 of places in town to be able to get my meds, that i must have, and the 3rd place i have to go is 4 hrs out of town to make sure i have all the meds i need on a daily basis to keep me healthly as i can be, and not only that, then after all three different appointments which are already spread out through the month, then i have to be able to make sure that i am also able to pick them all up!!!!! So after all that, now on to my question which i hope you guys can help me with, is there any way that i can have a doctor, or doctors online that will write my scripts for me just on a monthly or bi-monthly basis or whatever maybe at a affordable price, so then i can just pick the online pharmacy of my chocie or which ever you guys are whoever uses, may fill my much needed scripts, after one of your guys or some online doctors writes the scripts i need to be filled on one of the online pharmacys, and then simply be sent staright to my door, in a great discret pkg., and i will be able to get them way easier and not have to worry about how i am going to get them all each and every month, but better yet it just be all done over the internet and sent straightn to my front door, ohh my goodness that would make my already complicated life so much easier!!!!! Well anyways thanks for your time and all your efforet to help people in need like me, my friend reccommended you guys to me and said maybe, just maybe, you guys would be able to help me in one fron or another, so i thought, what the heck could it hurt, if you never try to get help, you never will get any help, right???

Actually, you have no symptoms of dyslexia and you have only stage fear. According to your narration, you are very sensitive and you always feel that you are making mistakes. You have a feeling like you were circumspect by others. But no one has time to observe you. Everyone will be busy with their own work. You get tears while watching sentimental scenes - it is quite common. Actually, you are a very talented person, you can do anything, only if you can delete all these negative thoughts from your mind. One suggestion for you. If you try to proceed with your next step in your career, there might be a 50 % chance of failure. But if you do not even try, there will be a 100 % failure. So try and try until you reach your goal. I have gone through all the symptoms you have mentioned in the query and came to a conclusion to select a homeopathic medicine which suits your symptoms - Gelsemium 1M (10 pills once in 5 days for 15 days) and after 15 days take Anacardium 1M one dose (10 pills) only.

The brain does not listen if other person speaks, or anything that requires moderate attention like a difficult lesson or an English movie or very new issues and tries to skip it. Due to this problem, I need to read the books, again and again, to get familiar to talk in public or practice it. Even if I practice many times, after some weeks, I cannot recollect what I read exactly. Due to this problem, I am unable to crack PG entrance. I feel ashamed. Even though I am a student of English medium, I fear to talk and search for words while talking. I tried to learn good fluent English, but I am unsuccessful. Is this dyslexia with combined neurasthenia too? I used to score 95 % but after this problem started, I am just able to stick to 60 % and I am unable to digest very low academic growth. There seems to be no treatment in allopathy for this.I feel back muscles ache and when I do some physical work, I feel full body ache. Even without any work, I feel back muscles ache. I sleep more. I am able to work more at night times than early in the morning. I wake up at around 8 to 8.30 AM whether I sleep at 9 PM or 2 AM. I try a lot. One should be able to wake up after six to eight hours of sleep and feel satisfied, but for me, it is not true. My polysomnogram was normal. More the mental work, I sleep more. For example, if I study for a few hours, I may need to sleep for 12 to 16 hours. While studying, I go to sleep. But while doing other works, I do not sleep automatically. Due to sleep, I have lesser time than others. In this time, I am facing difficulty to manage myself, wife, home, job, next level studies, business issues, outside problems, etc. I am very easily tired with mental work than physical work. I am ruled out for depression as my problems or most of the symptoms are starting only if I start reading (memory) or physical activity. Else, I feel somewhat alright. I got these three problems when I was 18 years old and these symptoms were not given attention by my parents.

I got these three problems when I was 18 years old and these symptoms were not given attention by my parents. Later, I went to hospitals but no proper treatment was given and I am trying to cope with them. But these dominate my self-confidence regularly.I have taken just one dose of Lycopodium 200, Baryta Carbonica 200 with one week gap. After taking Baryta, I have some discomfort and hence stopped. I tried Kaliphos few years ago and felt the symptoms aggravated and stopped using it. I have shown to doctors (psychiatry also) and they are unable to come to a specific diagnosis and said I am normal. My hemogram, CT, MRI, thyroid profile, and polysomnogram are normal. No alcohol or smoking or any other habits.Below, I am mentioning a summary of my mind and behavior to conclude what type of homeopathy medication personality I am:I fear to take change. For example, if I am doing a job, when any better job opportunity comes by, I fear to apply for change or travel. Hence, I am losing ways to improve in my field.I fear to talk in public.I fear when I see from the second or third floor of the building to down.I fear to tell lies. Many people easily tell lies and survive. For me even if it is mandatory, I feel difficult to lie. I am afraid of money matters. I will leave my money due to modest/bashful/hesitation problem. In this way, I am losing money.I cannot defend myself even though I know I am correct or right. I cannot convince others to accept what and why I did something. I just stand silently before them as if I did a mistake.I cannot convey properly what is in my mind and it comes out in a different way. Hence, even if I do better work than others, I am not focused enough to sell the idea.I hide my sad feelings inside.I cannot praise myself in front of others even if I did a good job where many people praise themselves even for a small work.Tears come while watching sentimental scenes in TV shows or movies. But I do not cry in real life easily. May be in childhood I cried, and later learned not to cry. I think more about other's feelings and care about them. I compromise myself. If my wife asks me for a huge sum of money, I give the money, even if I do not want to. But, when it comes spending even a small amount on myself I just let go even if it is something important.I change easily to other's feelings or moods or other's mentality. I lose my identity in the process sometimes and think later that I am changing and try to come back.I feel that I am having a struggle with my mind to keep it in track. An example is, I trained my mind not to eat rice (carbs) at night times. But, if I see people eating at night, I start eating (I adoptto their behavior).I am not rigid with my character or feelings.I think about money, but when I get money, I feel I do not care about it. This might make some people around me feel that I am stingy and a miser but the fact is I am not.People think differently and talk outside as if everything is normal. I tried to follow it but I am unsuccessful. Because to please somebody or to be happy, one should pretend or change to talking situations. Also, I put on weight easily. I stopped eating rice at night times. Just eating half of what other people eat for my age. My father is obese and may be I got those genes. Due to strict food control, I now weigh 68 kg which is near normal to my height.

It was lengthy but it contained only relevant thoughts necessary to express your deep rooted concern. First of all feeling nervous or anxious is common term and if you do not know what it means, I am sure you have never had that feeling. If you had that feeling you will know it throughout your life. I must inform you that common terms are difficult to define but almost everybody experiences that. What you are calling as emotional lability/unstability is normal reaction. That happens to any human over the earth. Your calmness and composure with others (except girlfriend) indicates that you are not labile and this is not rebound anxiety. It is possible that you are not satisfied with her relationship to one or another reason. Other than that with partners, having disputes is a normal phenomenon. So, stop calling it emotional lability and set a dialogue with your girlfriend about her doings which upsets you. By doing this you will be identifying the cause and rectify the problem all together. Since it is not rebound insomnia doing experimentation is not advisable. Your question is that if you take 0.5 mg in morning and afternoon what dose will you need in the evening. Since you are doing well with other drugs gradual reduction of the dose of Alprazolam is possible and it can be accomplished successfully by you.

I do not take any Alprazolam or any other benzodiazepines during the day. Also, I started taking Alprazolam about 6-8 months ago. Originally this was for a short period of insomnia due to a life situation where I was so worried about life that I could not sleep. The situation has long passed, and everything is fine now. I would like to slowly wean completely off of the Alprazolam so that. I no longer will take it. I am also being treated for bipolar depression, and I no longer feel depressed at all. But somehow, other benzodiazepines with longer half-lives such as Diazepam, Clonazepam and Clorazepate make me feel quite depressed within an hour or so of taking them. Actually pretty much any benzodiazepine besides Alprazolam makes me feel depressed. So, it seems like I have to wean off of the Alparazolam without substituting longer-acting benzodiazepines. I will go from 1.5mg to 1.25mg for a couple of weeks, then down to 1mg, then 0.75mg, etc., until I am not taking any anymore. At any rate, I am not sure if I am having interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day. I do not think I feel \\\"anxious,\\\" though I am not sure exactly what \\\"anxious\\\" means, to be honest, even though it is such a common term. I know I do not really spend much time worrying. I generally feel calm and at ease in life and about life. There is really nothing to worry about life because everything is going well for me. But perhaps I *would* be feeling more interdose withdrawal-related anxiety were it not for the antipsychotics and antidepressants I am taking. Perhaps they're ameliorating the anxiety that would have been there during the day between my evening alprazolam doses. But I have noticed lately that I am somehow a bit emotionally labile, at least when it comes to dealing with situations with my girlfriend. It is like she does something little that upsets me, something which I would ordinarily perhaps feel a bit poorly about or get a bit emotionally stirred, and ordinarily we would potentially have a conversation about it to solve this issue, or perhaps we wouldd get into a small fight or something. But lately when something happens which upsets me, it really, really upsets me. I can get easily angered or have some other odd negative emotional reactions. I wonder if this is a problem of interdose withdrawal from Alprazolam? It is possible, too, that it is just a development in my psyche, some kind of psychological problem only manifesting recently. But I wonder if it is possible, too, that I am having this experience as a withdrawal symptom between bedtime doses of Alprazolam. I can be in a perfectly good mood, or in a great mood, or in a normal mood, and one little thing happens with my girlfriend and everything is terrible all of a sudden, I feel terrible and I end up making her feel terrible. Have you heard of anything like this in terms of emotional lability/reactivity or anger or irritability something like that as a result of benzodiazepine withdrawal? Also, if I wanted to test this idea out and divide my bedtime alprazolam dose into, for example, three doses of 0.5mg each, is it possible that I experience insomnia as a nighttime withdrawal symptom? What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over.

What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over. But now, if I forget to take my 1.5mg alprazolam at nighttime, while I do no start worrying about anything, I just cannot fall asleep. And oddly, if I do start to fall asleep, I am suddenly sort of shocked/jolted back into being awake. This is not the type of insomnia I was being treated for where I just could not sleep because of worrying. I no longer worry or have much to worry about, and I think if I were not dependent on the Alprazolam, I would be sleeping just fine without it. I might be having trouble making this subtle point: It is that while I cannot sleep without my 1.5mg bedtime dose, I do no think it is due to an underlying insomnia, but rather a result of my being dependent on the Alprazolam for sleep after all these months. Is this is possible because of 6-8 months of use? And especially is the feeling of the insomnia is super different than how it was before. Before I just worried and could not sleep, but now there is no worry, I just feel awake in an odd way and cannot sleep, or if not, then I half fall asleep and suddenly startlingly awaken before I am fully asleep. So, now I am thinking of spreading my dose out, and instead of 1.5mg at night, maybe I would take 0.5mg in the morning, 0.5mg sometime later in the day, and 0.5mg before bed. If it is the case that I am experiencing insomnia as a consequence of my dependence on the drug, then would it be probable that I experience the same \\\"rebound insomnia\\\" (or whatever it is called) when I spread out the drug? That is, when I spread it out throughout the day and night, should the level of the drug in my blood be enough at nighttime that I do not experience this rebound insomnia? So that if there is some kind of insomnia at nighttime (during this experiment), it is not because of my Alprazolam dependence but rather due to an underlying insomnia? I wonder because I would not want to try this if you think it is probable that I would still have this rebound insomnia. I would only do it if the idea of it makes some sense to you. That is because I am only prescribed enough for 1.5mg per day, and the doctor is not willing to give me some extra during this period, so I have to be careful not to waste any if at all possible so that I'm not missing nights of sleep. Of course, if there's no way to know unless I try it, then I'll try it. But I would only stay away from the experiment if you think it does not make sense. So, if my brain is used to having 1.5mg at bedtime, then even if I took 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon, would I still need a whole 1.5mg at bedtime even though I already took 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg afternoon? Would my brain expect the whole amount at night because that is what it is used to, or would it accept that I already had 2/3 the dose morning and afternoon, and so the other 1/3 could be taken before bed? And finally I just want to say that I would like to try this because I am concerned that: 1. This emotional instability is an interdose withdrawal symptom. 2. The longer I am on the drug, the stronger the dependence gets so that it becomes more likely that I develop more severe interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day like panic attacks or something. If either of these are possible, then it would seem like a good idea to spread the dose out in order to avoid these things.

He was very routine oriented with waking at 5 am, shower 5.30  breakefast 5  45gym  6 am, ironing 7 am , bus to work 730, home 5 30 pm, cooking together at 6pm eating 7pm whilst he slowly introduced alchol into the equation with 4 beers and i bottle wine and with me sharing a glassor two or three. He was asleep onbthe the couch by 730 awake 830 the  to bed  by 9pm withonly cuddles from behind, he would cover my face withthe sheets. cuddles early morning before getting outof bed. sex only from behind very rarely in middle of night. e constANTLY spoke of previous relationships in a critisising way except with bragging about fantastic sex with previous partner, he stated that didnt work out as it was about sex and not real communicaiton or interpersonal relations. stated this time bonding without sex may be longer lasting first, then the physical component next. he was reluctanct to engage in going out to dinner, other social activities. over time, there was a bike ride once a fortnight only with his daughter , he was reluctant to do anything together just with the two of us except get a haircut or quickly in and out of the market for groceries for that nights meal. His left hand flapped about without me drawing attnetion to it as to reduce his possible embarassment. He stated he has a high IQ, but reluctantly showed evidence of that. He stated he could easy mess with my mind and that i could easily  be brainwashed. He was a gunna person.he didnt contribute to utiltiy costs and avoid transport costs.He prefered me to pick him up from worki in my car using my petrol with a direct bus at the front of his work to drop off at home. i thought it was a romantic thing to do but got annoyed he took advantage of my mother type picking him up.He always go t me to pay for a bottle of wine and said pay you back later, never did, he used my face moisturizer, took care of his body well with good food and exercise at the gym.", "start_char_idx": 210246, "end_char_idx": 214499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49011a1d-08f2-4d60-b1ed-1af8c7e2c2b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "49011a1d-08f2-4d60-b1ed-1af8c7e2c2b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "adf7029a-2222-4640-911c-ade1db1351db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "46a9b46963833c5f4c5d071f635d80559ee8333ba5d844e7f828c1285842329f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "17987e1e-ab7a-485a-ad3b-3ee1b0e852ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "939a8ba1bd75cddec6b5c8658dfa4833d5709724b974b5ffbcf25c6a317d6ff8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "His left hand flapped about without me drawing attnetion to it as to reduce his possible embarassment.

I changed my diet wake up time and some of my social activities to include him inmy home as he state he lost all he had in bad business deal. He went from woman to woman with his charismatic stoic use of few words monotone dialogue. if any interjection, he would say hear  me out, so my input would be minimal and feedback would be non existence. He had unusual theories on aliens altering our dna which caused our imperfections and short life span. he also had a tic with flapping his nose. if he notice me noticing he would reduce that behaviour. he was clumsy footed and would trip over a small obstical like a pair of shoes inthe way and reluctantly would walk down a small slope of dirt and stone ground, yet could easily ride his mountain bike down a much steeper slope. he can drive cars and motorbikes well and fast. appeared to have no fear with some things. he wouldnt go outside inthe dark to turn the hot water service back on and got quiet agitated with the hot water being off which altered his structure routine and agressively demanded that i get a plumber to fix the hot water. he wouldnt have a shower at the gym AS it wouldnt be hygenically clean enough so he went to his ex girlfriends place. this was followed withan  apology. he would walk in the dark for anight walk , but eventually did with walking along the side that was well lit. he stated he hated his mother and father as he stated he was abuse as a child.in the early stage or first meet he drew attention to detail with noticing and my hands with a critical type comment. he made other criitisims to my physical appearance , the way i walked, the way i spoke, the way i kiss (like a turtle). he said he wanted to find out what made me tic. he got agitated and agressive when i asked him to turn the radiostationto quiiete relaxint music whilst trying to get to sleep. he suddenly jumped out of bed yelling he has no where to go and called me spinner. i refused to engage in dialogue and said im not talking im going tosleep. this made him feel anoyed. he finally calmed down. this made me feel frightend.

I don\u2019t know what causes it or why there is such a thing let alone why it happened to me? But I check certain things in my home before I leave the house whenever I am going anywhere. I have to have some things a certain way in the cabinets in the kitchen and in my bathroom. I want the laundry to be folded just right and to be put away just so. And it takes me such a long time to get ready to go somewhere, what I mean is it interferes with my personal hygiene routine. I wasn\u2019t always like this and I can\u2019t even remember how I used to get ready for anything before. I have tried medication for OCD before and it made little difference plus the medicine gave me headaches. I have been told by a counselor in the recent past that there really isn\u2019t any medication to treat OCD. I have problems with depression, OCD, mood swings, anxieties, fibromyalgia, sinuses, allergies and I was diagnosed with a Vitamin D deficiency during the late summer of this year. I found out the hard way that I am allergic to Vitamin D pills or capsules because unfortunately for me it caused me to break out with hives and itching. Which I am still dealing with although it is not as bad as it used to be but that is another situation and story for another time later. I had been prescribed Buspar for anxieties and unfortunately it also contributed to the itching so I could no longer take that medication either. I was hoping to write to you about the problems that I have been having and experiencing with OCD and with personal hygiene. I have a very hard time convincing myself that I am clean, I cannot take a quick shower. It is taking too long for me to shave, shower and shampoo, therefore there are days when I am not even practicing personal hygiene. Because it is taking up too much time and I have other things to do. I really don\u2019t have any place to go to on an everyday basis anyway so the only time I am getting cleaned up is for a doctor\u2019s appointment, on a day I go to the store for grocery shopping and sometimes for taking care of some errands or for a family get together. Taking a shower and washing my hair should not be such a task or a hectic chore but sadly for me it is. I really don\u2019t feel good about myself anymore, I can\u2019t convince myself that I am lathered up with soap, that I am rinsed or that I am clean. Each part of myself from head to toe that has to be washed and cleaned to me it is as if it is mandatory to really pay attention to making sure that I am not scrubbing but going over myself with a wash cloth so many times. And it is the same thing when I am washing my hair and scrubbing or scratching my head with my finger nails and making sure that I am thoroughly rinsed, also what is taking up so much time is the shaving. The shower stall that I have in my bathroom is what you would call a telephone booth. I am used to a shower stall and bathtub combined with a shower curtain so that I have room to wash and shave my underarms and my legs. That is what I always had no matter where I lived up until I moved to in \u201907. But when I am in the shower stall that I have where I live now I just feel like I am boxed in. I don\u2019t know how many times I have accidentally busted either one of my elbows and since then one of them in particular doesn\u2019t feel right when I have my elbow up on the table. I have tried so many ways to shower differently and it never works. I don\u2019t think anyone here would care to read how long it takes for me when I am in the shower. If I shave in the shower then I end up with razor burn under my arms and cutting myself whether it is my underarms or on my legs. I have sensitive skin but if I shave before I get into the shower then I do so by filling my bathroom sink with water and getting the necessary areas wet and applying shaving cream. And then I have trouble convincing myself that I am shaved, I\u2019m still feeling stubble under my arms and I would think that when a woman shaves under her arms.", "start_char_idx": 220699, "end_char_idx": 225152, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec0c9048-de4d-413f-9c4a-32c77116b068": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec0c9048-de4d-413f-9c4a-32c77116b068", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62ed355a-cb16-4891-ae5e-7bd92e59f8f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "b80cac550c0d9b0b9bd801ac73d26ff6e07a7a593264b20855e80baf617cde13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83c8fb16-8b70-436e-8da1-98bb32b64375", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b3638294160f6441db8f9c1d06d0571fec2b9647cdda9f90dc34999b6bd874c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I don\u2019t know how many times I have accidentally busted either one of my elbows and since then one of them in particular doesn\u2019t feel right when I have my elbow up on the table.

Well, then that part should be clean and completely hairless. And I shave my legs and I have to go over them again because shaving them just once apparently isn\u2019t doing the job. These problems that I have been experiencing are a real pain and I can honestly say that I wasn\u2019t always like this. I don\u2019t have or more to the point can\u2019t afford an alternate method to shaving. Such as being able to afford going to a salon or a dermatologist for hair removal. Wax treatments from what I have come to know and understand are expensive and also are very painful. And I am very sensitive anyway, my dermatologist has also told me when I consulted him about this that there is no such thing as permanent hair removal. That body hair can be removed but it is only temporary and eventually it will grow back. I have been curious about the \u201cTry No No\u201d or the \u201cNo No Plus\u201d as well as the \u201cFlash \u2018n\u2019 Go\u201d. I would like to know if either one of them are legitimate? Are they genuine? Both of them do have a payment plan to pay for them although they are both expensive with a money back guarantee. And the \u201cTry No No\u201d does get advertised a lot. I talked to my family doctor about the \u201cTry No No\u201d during one of my previous appointments with her and she said that her husband had checked a website about it and he read the reviews. She told me that the reviews stated that the \u201cTry No No\u201d does not work. But I do have to wonder what do a lot of other people think? Does anyone here on these message boards have a different opinion about it? I hope that someone here can or will eventually post a response, I would really appreciate it a lot if a member and/or a doctor on the site could help me or at least could give me some helpful advice on what I should or could do. To make my life a little easier, I have tried counseling in fact I have been through counseling for several years. It has got to the point that I have just got sick and tired of counseling and getting up to get ready to go to a counseling session every one to two weeks or so. Talking to a friend or a counselor about my problems, worries, concerns, fears and sadness is really great and it helps but only for a short while. I apologize for going on into so much detail and for composing what turned out to be a very long message. But I felt I had no choice in order for me to explain my situation so that everyone here would understand. In hopes that I would receive a really good, positive and helpful answer to my inquiry. I hope everyone here has a good day, thank you and take care.\",\n        \"email\": \"wpuajt@yahoo.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"1045742187\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 7927,\n        \"Description\": \"Q.

Although tolerance is a major issue with all benzos, research has found that etizolam is associated with \\\"Reverse Tolerance\\\" a phenomena in which requirement for dose decreases with passage of time in contrast to tolerance. In two different studies reverse tolerance has been found for anti anxiety effects and anticonvulsant properties. In one another study etizolam was found to be associated with no tolerance for anti convulsant properties. Regarding its antidepressant properties, I am unable to comment at this moment as there are no studies which conclusively state that it has antidepressant properties. But if you extrapolate findings from available studies I am of the opinion that etizolam is significantly not associated with tolerance for its sedative, hypnotic and antidepressant properties. There is no consensus about development of tolerance for insomnia treatment as it is not available in countries which drive research in psychiatry. Other than this at present, it is recommended for short term use that might be the reason that no one knows its effect or side effect over long term use. According to your history that states you are maintaining on the same dose (2mg) for last three months, it is unlikely that you are going to develop tolerance for its sedative properties, as development of tolerance is affected by particular drug along with genotype of individual. Regarding my personal clinical experience with Etizolam: I started prescribing Etizolam in June 2010 when an Indian pharma company launched it in India. Since that time I used this drug for anti-anxiety properties in majority of individuals. Two of my patients who were prescribed etizolam are maintaining on the same dose for more than two years on the same dose (1 mg at bed time for insomnia and 0.25 mg twice a day for GAD Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Fortunately till date both of them are maintaining well till date and none of them complained of development of tolerance. Although it is recommended for short term use for the insomnia patient (almost duplicate copy of you) has found this drug after almost 1 year of suffering and he refused to discontinue this saying that \\\" doctor you know I am suffering for all these years. None of your prescriptions worked for me.\\\" After taking all precautions I decided to continue prescribing etizolam to that particular patient. Although my experience is limited (around 4 years) with Etizolam and it is difficult to make statement about etizolam but with available literature and according to my clinical experience I consider etizolam as non tolerance developing drug although it acts on benzodiazepine receptors. The reason behind different property of etizolam in comparison to other benzos, lies in its structure. Etizolam is exactly not a benzodiazepine. Its benzene ring is replaced by thiophene ring. It belongs to thienodiazepine derivative that acts on various benzodiazepine receptors. I hope I answered your query but still if you feel some thing is left, please contact me again. I will be happy to answer everything related to psychiatry. If you feel it is appropriate to have a face to face discussion you can get an appointment for an online video consultation.

I have even been treated with SSRIs and other drugs to rule out underlying anxiety issues. I find myself a very calm person, and my friends know me that way. Also I have been seeing various therapists for years in terms of learning to deal with modifying my lifestyle. I also meditate, practise yoga etc., and only the yoga/stretching helps, but just barely. Finally I was living in Japan for a while where a local psychiatrist put me on etizolam\u00a00.5mg to 2mg per night for sleep. I tried 0.5mg for a few nights without help. 1mg also did nothing. 1.5mg put me to sleep, but I still had this trouble with constantly waking up in the middle of the night as usual. So finally I tried 2mg, and that did the trick. For the first time in my life I could fall asleep at will and stay asleep all night until time to get up, and then not feel all sorts of sleepy/sickly side effects upon awakening. At least in the moment, this has been a wonder drug for me. Now I am back in the United States, so I get my etizolam sent in from abroad. I have been on it for three months at 2mg, sleeping successfully and living a better life, with no tolerance issues. Now, being that it is a benzodiazepine derivative, there is obviously the potential for tolerance. And while I know that with benzodiazepines tolerance is an issue, I also know that the potential for building a tolerance for each benzo depends on the condition being treated. For example my brother takes clonazepam daily for anxiety for years at the same dosage, and while most of the effects have worn off due to tolerance (euphoria, sedation), the anxiolytic effect is as strong as ever and he remains without unbearable anxiety just as well as the day he started. At the same time, if you are looking to \\\"get high\\\" on clonazepam, that effect, you might know, is gone pretty fast. And the anticonvulsant effects only last for a certain amount of time, too. I am sure none of this is new to you, and I only mean to point out that with the benzos the potential for tolerance depends largely on the symptom being treated. Might be a few weeks of good use of clonazepam for seizures, only a few days for getting high, a month for sedation but years for anti-anxiety (making these numbers up, but you see what I mean). And I only put this all here because I am afraid of getting this response that \\\"people build a tolerance to etizolam and so it must not be taken long term.\\\" Because the question is to which effect do people build a tolerance, and how quickly, and what percentage of the people, etc. So Iam wondering if there is a strong tolerance effect to etizolam for its anti-anxiety and (in Japan, at least) anti-depressant effect, how does it do for its anti-insomnia abilities? What is the consensus on this matter, and what is your own personal opinion? And has there been any research done on it at all, or is it all based on clinical observation/clinical wisdom? If there have been any studies could you point me to one or two? Have you personally prescribed etizolam for sleep? And if so, have you ever done it for daily use? And is it always, in your case, used only in the short term? And if you have seen patients use it for more than a few weeks/months, was there a point where it just was no longer effective? And how long did it tend to take for it not to be effective anymore? And finally, is it the case that it tends to work quite well for long term use for some patients but not for others, and if so, any idea as to whether it tends to work well that way for more patients or for less?", "start_char_idx": 231766, "end_char_idx": 235968, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fc5dac1-6258-4794-a2e4-2296021d5fb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fc5dac1-6258-4794-a2e4-2296021d5fb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3ca996c-912c-44fb-bbb2-d55227506ff8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "7568da932debd7103a6ddf5384d99c3af8f25cb02d9e1d060d43064fb80039ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "02519cd9-d040-44c8-be80-5ce4cc62e8a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4646ac5a0aefe6148af5c08fbf5c429818dafbb3601ba657310e4f6a9976917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "What is the consensus on this matter, and what is your own personal opinion?

What about his BMI (height required).In back ground of irregular heart beat, he needs 24 hour or 48 hour holter monitoring and defect needs to be worked upon if caught. In future patient should be strictly checked for allergy, any new drug if started.  There is a very high chance of getting any arrhythmia after CABG surgery so patient should be vigilantly monitored for any syncope or collapse and ideally should not go to toilets for an initial 7 to 10 days. Or at best for initial 15 days.  Joints other than  fractured ankle and other  3 limbs should undergo active or passive exercises as per convenience of patient.  Bed pan is good for him until and unless he is diagnosed for cause of his low bp and fainting spells.Ideally a senior physiotherapist should be consulted but so far as I know he should use his biceps. And arm muscles. By pumping a tennis ball. Light weight exercises for his upper limbs for 15 minutes thrice a day at minimum.   His tiredness needs to be evaluated for any excess or deficiency of vitamins, minerals, thyroid or any blood  count levels. The recovery of bone and cartilage in chest cage takes almost 1 to 1.5 months to recover.he need to wear a belt post operatively. Cause of low BP needs to be worked upon. I need list of medications which he is taking during his BP fluctuations, Ideal weight for his body according to BMI needs to be calculated.He should take enough healthy diet low in oil and ghee diet to maintain his weight at a fix.  .

This ended Monday afternoon accompanied by the most severe pain ever for next 24hrs or so in his lower right abdoman resulting in more morphine to ease the wrenching pain!His appendix was removed when he was 11 so a CT Scan was ordered which found kidney&gall bladder stones they feel were caused by the dehydrating effects from surgeries & meds& citrate! He s been thru so darn much &never took meds in his life except an occasional antibiotic for sinus infection &recently past 5yrs 10mg daily Lisinopril for maintenance purposes. So now he can t weight bear on right foot for 6weeks to 3months depending on how it heals...&he can t use his arms to push ,pull, lift, brace etc due to CABG for 8weeks or longer! Thus he can t use crutches so now instead of being home already &healing from triple bypass...walking being paramount in the well being of heart surgery patients...he is confined to bed in hospt-having to use lift to get him from chair to bed to toilet etc...&he once again had a fainting spell when on toilet in bathroom that was confining &had no circulation. He had finished having stool &was ready to be lifted off when he said he was feeling dizzy& it hit him fast. They got him in wheel chair when he was starting to pass out but he tried hard to remain conscious &did but it was scarey again! His vitals were ok again. The Doc-new one now down on TCC Unit(Transitional Care Center) where he can receive some kind of rehab therapy-cut back on some of his meds thinking could be causing this. I have noticed when he is up in wheelchair for an hour or more he gets tired easily & says he s starting to feel a little light headed. His BP has been recently 106 to 120 but tonight it was 95/58 at 4:30 pm. Is this too low?? He had just used the bedpan(cause they are afraid he ll get dizzy on toilet) about 30 minutes prior. So they didn t give him his blood pressure med. Then at 9pm BP was 114/62.

I see how this is a strain for him &needs to lay down afterwards & u can see it in his eyes. Is all this just because he can t get up & walk like he should be doing-&his body just isn t use to being up & heart isn t use to pumping when body in upward position? &the low blood pressure is very concerning cause he could faint &be crippled for life or worse! This is a man who exercised & was basically healthy before all this! What exercises can he do with his arms now that won t hurt his CABG?! Will this tired dizziness ever leave him? When could he use crutches &be really safe in not damaging the CABG?! What is the remedy for the low BP? For I Know he has to take some BP meds rest of his life after bypass surgery-right? He s also afraid to eat too much cause he s confined to the darn bed due to one individual s lack of professionalism in caring for him!

I appreciate your deepest concern for your unborn children and painstaking effort to get as many opinions as you get. I hope you haven't jumped into hasty decisions by the time you receive this answer. First of all, AKT4 contains 4 drugs that are rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide.All these are first line drugs for tuberculosis.Let's consider one by one,1. Isoniazid belongs to category A drug and is considered safe in pregnancy.2. Pyrazinamide is a category B2 drug which means no studies has been done or data is available regarding its safety but fetal malformations aren't reported. WHO and International Union against TB and Lung diseases support its use in pregnancy although Centre for Disease Control(CDC) says it can probably be used safely in pregnancy.3. Rifampicin is category C drug and is considered safe to use in pregnancy by WHO.Bleeding side effect in newborn and the mother is related to its use in last few weeks of pregnancy and can be prevented by using vitamin k injections.4.Ethambutol is category A drug and safe to use in pregnancy.  P.S-There are very rare risks associated with these drugs. But it doesn't strictly warrant termination of pregnancy. Hope this helps. Enjoy your parenthood with utmost joy.

Would go to get professional assistance if a confident suggestion was brought up. I am not trying to self diagnose but the closest I could find online was Anhedonia.For the longest time I have dealing with issues pertaining to lack of interest in things, lack of finding any sort of pleasure, and generally getting no excitement from anything. This issue is getting worse and worse as I get older and with medicine advances nowadays I feel as though there is someone out there that can diagnose the problem and help me find some resolve. Until recently I thought it was just a problem of depression or anxiety and have been on different medications throughout the years which never ended up resolving the core issue. I believe anxiety and depression are a byproduct of the true issue. I recently had a real open conversation with my mother and found she has lived with this same issue her entire life (a couple other relatives on the same side have signs of this also). Both my mother and I are not lazy people, she got a degree from Ohio State University and after raising 3 kids she went back to school and got another degree in nursing but she told me it was hard to get going on it. I got an Electrical Engineering degree from a reputable university. I believe there is a solution out there and not only would I like to resolve the problem for myself but I would love it to be resolved for my mother, though she says she doesn't have many years left anyhow I would love her to live those happily without this issue.The only medication that seems to have a good affect on me is adderall.

Maybe not 100% better but I feel almost normal and functional.Every time she would try to explain to someone the issue she ended up with the same response I got when I tried to explain so we both just gave up.

Here I go trying to explain it:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* In the evening or early morning I am almost in a vegetative state (since the adderall is only working from about 9am - 2pm).

Others have attempted treatment such as bipolar (wrong in 1987), depression/anxiety (maybe but have been on multiple different medicine), even told when in High School I may have a learning disability but, come on, I got an Electrical Engineering degree from a ranked Engineering university. It's getting worse and I do not want to live a life of not enjoying things, not able to have friends, not getting excited like others when something great is happening. I have other feelings such as empathy, love, fear, nervousness, caring, etc.I force myself to exercise 3 to 5 days a week (weights and cardio), I eat healthy (vegetarian and sometimes just raw food diets), I make sure I get the protein and vitamins I need daily. I am 6' 1\\\"; 165 lbs. No one in my family has a weight problem. There is no drug or alcohol abuse. I do not smoke. I was never a lazy person, I have tried and participated in almost every sport you can name (Jack of all trades, master of none). I have lived in different countries around the world (including Iraq in 2003 - 2004 as a civilian contractor). I have a very good job and am seen as the expert in my field but it too is starting to take a hit from this. When I was very little I had no problems making friends and having really close friends. I did find enjoyment in even the simplest things. I anticipated things like going to an amusement park and getting excited. I used to have passions for fishing, skiing, tennis, rocks, weather, learning, etc. I know what it is supposed to feel like but now the world, people, and everything is bland. I am NOT even close to any suicidal thoughts. I am very sane and rational. It is just driving me crazy because I remember and would love to enjoy things again, have close friends, volunteer and do things on the weekends for others. Would love to show what I believe to be my true self and not come off as whiny, negative or lazy. This is a serious issue and if others are being mis diagnosed and feeling this way I feel for them because it is not a fun way to live.

There can be underlying causes such as elevated adrenal hormones which cannot be checked while on any of these drugs which cause that to occur anyway. BUT the tumor can be looked for. Otherwise this is classic for chronic fatigue with the orthostasis.  There can also be chronic fatigue due to depression/psychological reasons but that doesn't have blood pressure effects and you'd need to get the BP under control before you could say there are independent psychological issues other than obvious OCD. Diabetes, both type I, II and insipitus can cause this but if you aren't up all night urinating, forget I mentioned it. Without an exam, I can only give general information, but, this is some about CFS. Once one can stand, exercise of every type basically fixes it. Muscle and endurance building and also getting used to the BP fixes it, but you have to be able to exercise.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

In late January as part of an effort to find the cause of my implacable lethargy and nudged in this direction by recurrent episodes of greying out that were becoming more frequent, I underwent a tilt table test. The results were that my heart rate increased from ~ 80 bpm to 130 bpm upon being tilted (the increase began sharply as soon as I was tilted) and this heart rate gradually settled down to about 100 bpm after twenty minutes. I was given sublingual nitrate which caused my heart rate to increase again to ~ 130 bpm. The heart rate increase was accompanied by palpitations which lasted until the test was completed but on the day of the test doctors were unable to replicate my symptoms of presyncope. No syncope occurred during the test. For days after the test I was very significantly impaired. Other symptoms I experienced that appeared to be related to a common condition included: severe post-prandial fatigue (to the point it was difficult to organise my thoughts and even to talk for about 2-3 hours after eating a meal\u2014a sandwich with wholemeal bread would be enough to trigger this), cognitive sluggishness (not too remote from the complex of symptoms an ADHD person would experience), post-exertional fatigue (I would not be able to function adequately after exercising and was effectively bed or chair-ridden until I had a very long episode of sleep\u2014for obvious reasons I would never, ever exercise in the morning), fatigue in response to being in any sort of hot environment (especially hot showers), muscular discomfort (mostly after exercising, it was very similar to what one feels preliminary to stretching) that would be relieved temporarily by stretching and gave me urges to compress affected limbs (I would place one leg in tight spaces, for instance in between lounge cushions on which one generally sits and the backrest of a lounge), urges to lean on things while standing (such as bathroom mirros while brushing my teeth) and excessive thirst (a relative counted twenty-eight 600mL bottles of water on the floor near my bed once). It was inductively strong that the episodes of greying out and other symptoms, according to specialists I am in consultation with, were related to the observed phenomenon during the tilt test which confirmed a diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia. I was given Inderal 40mg, half of which I was instructed to take twice daily, so 20mg in the morning upon waking up and 20mg at night. My response to the medication was uncanny in the positive stense.

I was given Inderal 40mg, half of which I was instructed to take twice daily, so 20mg in the morning upon waking up and 20mg at night. My response to the medication was uncanny in the positive stense. For several days, after years of this illness, I was asymptomatic. I was expecting to make a full recovery but my symptoms began returning after about a week. Some symptoms appeared to be remain controlled by the Inderal, including the post-prandial fatigue and accompanying drowsiness, but others, such as the muscular pain, the cognitive sluggishness, the greying out and the muscular pain, began returning. I expressed the failure of the medication to control my symptoms beyond a week to my doctor, and he wanted to increase my dosage as he apparently always intended because I am a big guy and a 20mg dose of Inderal twice a day (40mg/day) is what he would give a six year old (actually, I m not a big guy at all, I am 70kg and 6 0\u201d). My dose was increased to a full tablet at night and half a tablet in the morning and then once again to one full tablet in the morning and one at night over the period of two weeks (it worked out to be more than that). All of the symptoms that were returning before the dose was increased the first time worsened, and suspicions that the Inderal was influencing my mood seem to be confirmed by my moodiness getting worse as well, so now I began experiencing a side effect. I quickly tapered my dose from 80mg/day to 60mg/day and then back to 40mg/day. In the last 24 hours I have taken 20mg two times, so it has been a very short time since the tapering of the medication finished. It is important to stress there has continues to be a full resolution of my post-prandial fatigue, which was the most distressing of my symptoms, but I am at a total loss for why my improvement for the first few days of taking the medication was so holistic and significant, whereas now I am once again impaired, even now when I m on a similar dose to that I first took. I have tried many medications in the past, including ones prescribed for depression because doctors suspected I was atypically depressed, and they have not yielded the same results as Inderal. There have been no significant changes in lifestyle or diet since starting the treatment, with one exception, so what may account for the initial efficacy of the medication versus its efficacy now? I do know that propranolol reduces the sodium present in urine and sodium affects blood pressure and blood volume, and the major change in my diet over a long period has been a decrease in the amount of salt I consume, which I imagine is still relatively high. However, over the last 24 hours I have been consuming more salt, a deviation from the trend, to no avail, at least yet. My blood pressure is not too low, not too high . I am looking for alternative explanations. Should I push for my doctor to prescribe a second line of treatment, in the form of a medication like midodrine or fludrocortisone? Would you personally approve of a second-line pharmacological intervention if I was one of your patients? Should I be concerned about interactions between my current medication, propranolol, and any of these two other medications that make one of them less effective or that imperil my health, save that fludrocortisone requires auxiliary potassium supplementation? To summarise my questions: What may account for the initial efficacy of the Inderal versus its efficacy now? Given the dose has remained the same? Should I broach with my doctor my thoughts about using more medications, to target the postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom complex in different ways? Do you personally think more intervention is warranted given that the medication I am taking now is not having the effect it did?

You are suggested to get physically examined for hypertension & get treated for it. Hypertension can be the root cause that triggers many of your symptoms.   Maintain a normal blood pressure level. You can do thins with the help of antihypertensive (calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, Ace inhibiors, etc) medications under a doctor.  You can maintain it by regulating your diet. Avoid alcohol & addictions if any. Avoid red meat, trans fat, full-fat dairy, butter, etc.   Since you have symptoms of nausea, abdominal discomfort, indigestion; get liver function tests done. A sick liver will cause fatigue, exhaustion & weakness. Get treated at the earliest.  Take boiled homemade food. Take food that is easily digestible in small amounts 4-5 times a day, take veggies, soups, ORS & juice to keep yourself well hydrated.   Hydrocele if left untreated will cause blocked blood flow to the testicle causing severe scrotal, pain, swelling or testicular torsion.   Untreated varicocele may cause infertility due to low sperm production & decreased sperm quality.   Get physically examined & treated. You may require a minor surgery. Numbness that you are experiencing is indicative of some developing Peripheral Neuropathy.   If you are diabetic control your blood sugar levels to avoid worsening of the symptoms.  Take food rich in vitamin B6, B12, folic acid along with minerals(calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc). You can also take vitamin supplements.  If required get Nerve Conduction test & Nerve biopsy done. Do regular exercises. Stay away from stress.   It looks like you have neglected your health immensely, its time to take care of yourself. Do not panic have patience, get treated. Slowly your symptoms will go away.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Take care  Regards, Dr Nupur K, General & Family Physician \",\n        \"Patient\": \"I am a self employed, 48 year old black male.  At the age of 28 I started treatment for borderline hypertension.  Several years ago I developed diarriha which has stayed for months at a time broken only by a day or less. I also had bladder problems and urinated at least 4 time during sleep hours.  I have been feeling extremely ill for over 24 months. It started suddenly one day when I noted what felt like a tight band around my right wrist.  My hand would later became a bit numb, but that sensation would subside.  After a few weeks, the tight band sensation seemed to migrate up into my left elbow and the weakness continued.  After the elbow, the weakness moved up to my shoulder and caused what I can only describe as a nearly useless left arm.  it was very weakened and I was not able to lift or get much use from it.  This would go on to last for several weeks.  During this period I was bothered by the weakness, and assumed it was something of a pinched nerve.    However,since I am a right hander, I simply used that dominate hand while waiting for the issue with the left hand to subside.  The numbness in the left arm and hand lasted for more than two weeks.

Just as suddenly the arm issue had arrived it disappeared.  Nearly a month later the same numbness appeared to begin in my right arm.  But, after a few days of the tight band feeling on my wrist, it was gone.  Several days later, I began to feel what I described at the time as a slight twisting sensation in my left testicle.  That light sensation soon became a full blown twisting feeling in the right testicle and up into the lower right abdominal area.  On the second day, the pain in those areas was unbearable and I found myself in an emergency clinic.  I was advised to alternate ice and heat on my groin area. Since no swelling was observed I was told it was ok... given advil and sent home.  Over the course of the next several weeks I began to be extremely fatigued.  I could only function for approximately 2 hours in the early day.  No amount of sleep or rest changed that exhaustion.  The exhaustion was soon followed by what I would later come to describe as almost hourly hotflashes.   These hot flashes initially the hotflashes were in my face and shoulders.  However, they soon spread to my shoulders, chest, and arms.  Additionally, I began to feel very mentally slowed.  My memory was seemingly failing and my abilities to complete my normally routine tasks became a true challenge.  During these early days I was treated by my private doctor who advised me that I appeared yellowish... and might be anemic.  He also informed me that my prostate was very enlarged...Complete blood panels would come to show that I had high lymphocytes, low neutrophils, low platelets, low testosterone, lowered liver and kidney functioning.   Except for liver and kidney tests, These results would remain constant for the next two years testing each 60 days.  Additionally, the tests would show very low vitamin D and Potassium for the entire period. After exhausting my financial resources, I was left to seek care and answers at the local VA hospital.  After repeating the tests, the VA doctors continue to find those same results.  Throughout this period, I have experienced night sweat from light to extremely heavy.  The VA Doctors started tellng me there is no signs of lupis.  They say prolonged diarriha may be irritable bowel and the hot flashes and pain in my right testicle and right groin may be in my mind. In approximately May 2011, I began to experience painful nodes in my neck and under my chin.   Ocassionally, they would be swollen but most often just a bit painful.  This was soon followed by a loss or change in my vocal quality.   Soon, that same pain had spread to my upper chest just below the clavacles.  That was followed by pain and soft puffiness in the clavacle spaces.  Nothing can be felt there but soft puffy swelling... like a soft balloon on each side.   Additionally,  I have started having intense pain in my achilles tendons and hand tendons.The doctor ignores my thyroid questions because my TSH is within some expected ranges.  All tests are negative for infection however, I feel horrible. Although those statements about these issues being in my mind have eased since the discovery of the varicocele and hydrocele in my right testicle.  After nearly 18 months of the same complaints and symptoms... an ultra sound completed at my insistence would finally show the varicocele as cause of the pain. In August 2011, i was rushed to the hospital with a fever of 105 degrees.  No infection was found and the fever was listed as a fever of unknown origin.  After several IVs and a dose of potassium, I was sent home with a fever of 101.

I suggest you not to worry much. Anxiety is fear of something which may or may not be true or may or may not happen in the future. Anxiety is known to produce so many weird symptoms which has no physiological back up. They tend to be just obsessive. Such a fear is carried by everyone in the world. But everyone do know they have no control over such future events and therefore it is futile to think and worry about them. Secondly, nobody has enough time to think about it. Thirdly everyone are busy living, there is no other alternative except living properly. There is no escape in thinking what shall happen in future with the relationship. So you should leave it to fate and belief and do what ever you want to do today.Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

Also, I was bullied at school, but when i told her she simply say it s because I was a bad girl that I will get bullied. I was bullied because I was too quiet and shy at school.

At Cegep, I helped my mom at her restaurant part-time. However, at University, i wanted to stop since it was too hard for my psychology program. I was almost failed the school. At the end of my graduation, i could never reach neither master nor doctorate degree, but manage to graduate from my bachelor degree with a average grade but not enough to go higher into master. To graduate, I had to study part-time, and continued on during summer vacation. I took me more years to graduate. If I didn\u2019t help he at the restaurant, she would kick me out of the house. My parents, mom never really wanted to celebrate my graduation from elementary,high school,cegep nor my university. However, they still came to high school graduation and university. During high school, i told them i would really want them to go. During university, my husband (bf back then) told them that I really want their presence and he wanted to propose to me on that day. My mom also ruined my proposal day, she told me days before that he was gonna propose to me and to behave properly, My mom really like my boyfriend back then. Later on, i changed to study as paralegal, i managed to have good grade, always in between 80% to 100%. But whenever, i told her she never congratulated me. When it was not a 100%, she felt it was not a good grade. Therefore, there is no need for compliment. During my adulthood, when I found my husband, back then fiancee. She has to do a whole scene, like in movie, to stop me from being with him because he wasn t her ideal guy. She started to dislike him because he tried to help me. He told my mom that i felt neglected by her. If she could show more affection toward me. My mom took it as a offence and start to dislike him. During the planification of my wedding, I was always sad or crying. She never helped me during the planning but only complained. She didn t accept him nor my wedding but wants to be honoured as my mother during the ceremony. I wanted her during my planification, but she refused our wedding. How could i ask her opinion on something she refused.? After 3 years, i still cry for my ruined wedding. I would be envious whenever i see a mother helping her daughter preparing for her wedding. I feel guilty for this, being happy but yet jealous. I only had help from him and my friends during my wedding. Now being married and finding my job as paralegal, I finally start to find my own sense of identity. But yet she always has to complain about how i dress too office . I work at a law firm!! Whenever i buy a new clothe, i am afraid to show her. When I got a very good raise by my boss, i didn t want to tell her.

I do gym everyday and like my body. I wish she could stop. Now I am so tired, that I don\u2019t really want to meets her.

I only use my sister as I way to say I go visit her.Each time i see her, i always end up reminding me of unhappy things. However, I noticed that since I was deprived of motherly love as a childhood, now I have become very dependent and clingy on my husband. I placed on the affection I lacked on him. I always ask for his attention ,like a attention freak. I felt he was the only one who love me. I am afraid i will push him away. He still loves me now, but I feel i am over controlling him, always needing for this care and attention. Whenever we argue over something, I start to think no one loves me.. i am alone. Could you please help me, I dont want to live in the past.l I dont want to be burdened by my mom and be her puppet. Nor do I want to burden my husband that love me solo much. i want to be more independant. I want to live my own life the way and be myself. I also wanted to tell you that i started to gather my courage to tell her how i fee about her, but yet she never took it too seriously. Saying it was for my own good.

My weight is 22 stone, but I am pretty active despite my weight. I am neither easily fatigued from being active nor do I ever feel breathless other than normal. There is no history of peripheral artery disease in my family or coronary artery disease and to my knowledge; there has been no heart attack in my family or episodes of sudden cardiac death. I am a non-smoker and I do not drink alcohol. My concern is that I suffer regularly with aches and pains in my legs, soles of feet, arms, shoulders and my chest. I do suffer costochondritis. The pain is never severe; it is more of a dull ache or a pulling sensation. If I had to rate the pain out of 10, I would say the discomfort is not more than 1 or 2 and maybe 3 at the worst. I feel that I have severe health anxiety and I do regularly check my pulse, blood oxygen and blood pressure. I have had numerous ECGs and of which, I will attach three for your reference. I have also had a coronary calcium score before 5 years, which was zero. I have had every blood test, including cardiac enzymes a number of times and my blood work is always normal except for borderline low testosterone. My cholesterol also in borderline and I am managing it through diet. Initially, I had chest pain before six years. I had a consultation with my GP and he organized a coronary calcium score due to a dramatically elevated cholesterol level. CCS was normal and I began a treatment of Atorvastatin. There was no further issue for the next three years. Then, when I was involved in moving a disabled person from a high rise apartment and was lugging furniture and other household items up and down five flights of stairs, I felt unwell, chest discomfort and pain in the arms. Also, I felt dizzy and fast pulse. I attended A and E promptly and they performed an ECG. But, it showed nothing and cardiac enzymes were also normal. The only thing there was an inverted T-wave, which the cardiologist was not concerned with as it was only in one lead. Two years ago, I attended A and E again with chest pain. Another ECG was performed along with a chest x-ray and all of which were normal. I was kept in overnight for routine observation and in the morning I was visited by a cardiologist. He felt that the issue was muscular and not cardiac in origin and I was subsequently sent home. Before 10 months, I attended my GP surgery to discuss my past and was told that it was a likely anxiety disorder. To settle my mind, I asked my GP to perform an ECG and the machine autogenerated a diagnosis of possible peri-infarction age undetermined. This subsequently triggered a panic episode. My GP checked it and said if I had been presented this ECG without the autogenerated diagnosis then he would say it was a perfectly normal ECG. As I asked for a second opinion, he sent my diagnosis to a cardiologist. The reply sent was I find it highly unlikely that this gentleman has ever had an MI. However, if he is still concerned, then consider a referral for stress echocardiogram. I opted for the stress echo. When I met with the consultant cardiologist, he told me that it was not anything to worry about as everything appeared normal and was basically an anxiety based. He advised no further tests necessary and discharged me as healthy with a diagnosis of GAD. Before three months, I attended A and E with chest pain and discomfort following a stressful day. Another ECG was taken and everything was normal apart\u00a0from Q waves in lead 3.", "start_char_idx": 284905, "end_char_idx": 289257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f8ea9e6-15a4-44ab-9b4c-605167b918f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f8ea9e6-15a4-44ab-9b4c-605167b918f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e04454d-b200-4a17-a5d7-74e17dd29675", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "65aada92ef7080bff00a39f125ef63f9450d4c28ae141f17d99fd0450448511d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7857e35f-0cd2-49d4-b08a-e6e77a04e50a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36b5f774d897768517ce52f7f45c8f8dc2f2ee05fd3337bb23b7e2edcc590aa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This subsequently triggered a panic episode.

Another ECG was taken and everything was normal apart\u00a0from Q waves in lead 3. A and E consultant examined ECG and reported no change from earlier ECGs. A month later, I had an ambulance call out to the home address. Two ECGs were taken in one hour difference. The first again showed inferior infarction, age undetermined and QRS duration (corrected) 491 ms. Ambulance crew said it is fine and otherwise a normal ECG. All other observations are normal with oxygen 99% and somewhat high BP. It was likely anxiety again. The second ECG showed a normal QRS duration and no other issues. I was advised to see GP for anxiety medicines I visited my GP last month. He repeated ECG again and it was normal. He gave me Sertraline and said based on my entire history that it is definitely not a cardiac chest pain. From last month, I started a new job at the hospital. Due to shoulder pain and leg pain, I attended A and E and an ECG was performed allegedly and it did not show any of the previous Q waves from earlier ECG's and appeared completely normal. The cardiac enzymes were taken and were reported normal. The final diagnosis was anxiety. Yet, again, I attended A and E in the last month as my fitbit showed that my pulse was elevated to 159. When I rushed to A and E, my pulse was 144. On arrival at A and E, I had my BP taken 154/94 mmHg. My spo2 was 100% and pulse was 114. Another ECG was performed and the nurse informed me that everything normal except QTC. So, I was asked to repeat an ECG by the consultant there. The second one was reported to be normal. In the meantime, I had panicked and checked on the internet regarding QTc durations and learnt about sudden cardiac death due to the long QTc syndrome. The nurse very bluntly told me that it was very highly unlikely to happen to me as I had no other symptom. Again, I was just diagnosed with anxiety. I have still been getting the pain in the back of my leg, around the sole of my foot, shoulder and a very slight ache in my jaw. Also, I feel some chest pain, but I relate this to my costochondritis. Please be aware that all the pain mentioned above is the same that I have presented with for a number of weeks or months and have attended A and E. Is it true that all this can be due to anxiety? Should I worry about QTc? Does my ECG look like I have ever had a heart attack? What could be causing the other pains? Sometimes, while taking a rest, my fitbit reports my pulse to be as low as 54 and when walking my pulse tends to be around 114 to 120 bpm. When it is around 120, I can feel my heart beat. One thing that is new and has recently nerved me is the ability to hear my pulse most often after running up my flight of stairs from living room to bedroom. The heartbeat can be heard externally for only a few seconds, maybe 10 at the most and then settles back to normal. This incidence occurs when I am highly anxious, during pre-anxiety attacks and only when I have done something like running upstairs. Recorded pulse during this audible heart beat is usually 120, but then within 2 minutes again that will drop to normal range.

The pain varies in place, but it is always centered on my left temporal area. Pain can be on the top of my head, cheek, side of jaw and even chin at times. I have also had momentary ear pain, which is a brief one second flash perhaps inner ear pain for the last week.\u00a0I went to my doctor after the first week of non-stop pain. Ironically the pain had eased that day and I was left with a sense of pressure in my temple area. It was disrupting my sleep. My heart rate was a bit high. He took an ECG there and he was not sure why I had the headache, so sent me to other hospital. He also looked into my eyes and thought I may have a blurred left optical disc.\u00a0I had another ECG at the hospital and my pulse rate was still high, sinus tachycardia. But, the nurse told me that everything else with my heart was reading fine. The treating doctor ran through the usual questions and gave a neurological exam. I passed everything from looking into my eyes with a light to reflex tests and making me push him away with my arms and legs and opening my eyes while he pressed gently on them with his fingers. He also ran blood tests and they came back normal. He was not sure what the problem was and was not convinced that my left optical disc was blurred. As it was 1 AM he suggested me to stay overnight, so that I could see a consultant or specialist first thing in the morning. I had my blood pressure taken once again at around 4 AM and the nurse said it was still a little high, but everything was fine.The next morning consultant or specialist saw me for about a minute. He did not even acknowledge my heart rate, just said that as I was feeling totally normal and had no other symptoms other than the pain it was likely a benign tension headache. I was better off at home rather than stuck in hospital. Based on what the treating doctor said he too was not convinced that I had a blurred left optical disc, but wanted me to see an eye doctor at the hospital. I had an eye examination and everything was fine, other than the fact that I need glasses, which I already knew. No issues were detected and my left optical disc was fine. I was then discharged and went home. I asked a nurse about my sinus tachycardia just before I left hospital and she said that the heart does that sometimes and being in hospital or going to the doctor does not help as I was well and healthy. The first thing I did when I got home was checked my heart rate monitor app that I have on my phone. It uses the torch on my phone to detect color changes in one finger to measure beats per minute.

The first thing I did when I got home was checked my heart rate monitor app that I have on my phone. It uses the torch on my phone to detect color changes in one finger to measure beats per minute. I have read that it is very accurate. My resting heart rate at this time was around 75 bpm. I was relieved and put my heart rate down to the anxiety of going to see my doctor about the persistent headache and then having to unexpectedly go to hospital. In the three weeks since my hospital visit I have still got the headache. The pain is in the same place around left temple area, side of jaw, cheek, top of head. The pain is not severe, but annoying. Lying down to sleep at night is what seems to make the pain worse, even after a pain-free day. The pain would flare up as soon as my head hit the pillow, including at the back of my head and yet when staying with my girlfriend I would not get this when sleeping on her pillow. I decided to see my doctor again yesterday after having a sleepless night. I had 48 hours mostly pain-free and occasional pangs of pain. I slept at home fine, then the next night at my girlfriend's fine and then the next night the moment I went to sleep the pain came on and I could not sleep all night. Painkillers would not help. I was also experiencing a kind of dizziness, unless it is all in my head. Nothing spinning or dramatic, but just sometimes felt a bit odd briefly when moving, only when moving. Balance is fine. I had felt this the day after returning from hospital, but it was gone within 24 hours, so I have been free of it for two weeks.I saw a doctor again. He did not have a specific diagnosis, but backed up the idea that it was a benign headache. I have not been stressed or having personal problems as such, so he ruled out anything there. He said pain at the back of the head when laying down can be quite serious, but could not understand why I get that pain at home but not at my girlfriend's house, so said it could not be serious in that case. I was asked to rate that pain out of ten when I get it in bed, I said it can be about 6/10. He asked about a history of migraines which I do not have. Asked if I had any other symptoms which I did not. He checked my oxygen levels and blood pressure. He said my BP was shooting, but I said it was anxiety because two weeks prior it had returned to normal as soon as I got home from hospital, so I thought it was likely high because I was anxious of being at the doctors. He prescribed me 2 x 28 tablet boxes of Naproxen 500 mg twice a day and asked me to let him know how I was getting on with it after five days. He also checked my jaw, pushed down on my shoulders, etc., and all was fine. He said I would not have been discharged from hospital if anything sinister was considered. I asked if I had more pain whether it was something sinister and he said yes and that they have given me a head scan if they were concerned. I took my third Naproxen pill about an hour ago. I took my first at about 6 PM yesterday and it took care of the pain within about 20 minutes. Because I had not slept at all since the pain came on when I went to bed the night prior I was suffering with it all day, but the Naproxen killed it. It wore off after about five hours and I started to feel the pain come back, but I took two Paracetamol and went to bed. I slept fine and I have had a pain-free day today, although I get very occasional pangs in the left side of my head, but only for a second. I still have the very slight dizziness when I move however. I am not sure whether dizziness is even the right word. I have read that it takes about two weeks for Naproxen to give off a constant anti-inflammatory affect that can break the cycle of benign headaches. Is this correct? I have been keeping track of my heart rate through my phone app. When I am very well rested it falls in the 60s and 70s, but my average resting heart rate seems to be 80-90 bpm.

(Scabies )Scabies is a condition of very itchy skin caused by tiny mites that burrow into your skin. The itching is caused by an allergic reaction to the mites.Scabies spreads very easily from person to person. It can affect people of all ages and from all incomes, social levels, and living situations.With treatment, the scabies mites die and the itching goes away over a period of days to weeks. Without treatment, the mites continue to reproduce under the skin, causing more sores and itching.Scabies has two main symptoms:Severe itching that is usually worse at night. Small children and older adults tend to have the worst itching.A rash with tiny blisters or sores . Children tend to have worse skin reactions than adults.How is it treated?you need to use a special cream,These products contain permethrin.Permethrin 5% cream (Elimite) is the treatment of choice for scabies. Permethrin 5% cream is applied to clean, dry skin. For best results, clip and clean all fingernails and toenails. Permethrin is usually left on the skin for 10-14 hours and then washed off in the shower. It is best to apply permethrin at bedtime and then wash it off in the morning.Lindane 1% cream or lotion is an older medication that is rarely used because it is potentially toxic to the nervous system (leading to symptoms such as dizziness or seizures). Some scabies have become resistant to Lindane.Ivermectin pill(s) (Stromectol) is an oral medication that is active against several parasites. It is not FDA-approved for use in scabies but has been used in cases with very heavy infestations. Ivermectin is not used in small children or in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Malathion 0.5% lotion (Ovide) is usually used for head lice and is not approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of scabies. It is irritating to the skin. It must be used only as directed and should be kept out of the reach of children because ingestion may cause organophosphate poisoning.Benzyl benzoate lotion is an older treatment for scabies. It can be irritating to the skin, especially in people who have eczema.Crotamiton lotion or cream (Eurax) is approved for use in adults with scabies.

In most cases, you leave the medicine on for 8 to 14 hours and then wash it off. Be sure to read and follow all instructions that come with your medicine.To make sure that all the mites are killed:Wash all clothes, bedding, and towels that you used in the 3 days before you started treatment. Use hot water, and use the hot cycle in a dryer. Another option is to dry-clean these items. Or seal them in a plastic bag for 3 to 7 days.Clean and carefully vacuum the room or rooms used by the person who had scabies.After treatment, the itching usually lasts another 2 to 4 weeks. It will take your body that long to get over the allergic reaction caused by the mites. Antihistamines (such as Benadryl), steroid creams, or, in severe cases, steroid pills can help relieve itching.If you still have symptoms after 4 weeks, you may need another treatment. and visit doctor.I wish was helpful for  youBest regardsDr. Ahmed Habib \",\n        \"Patient\": \"We were just moving into a new apartment and my girlfriend's daughter's boyfriend was helping us move things in for several days.  About 76 hours ago, before my girlfriend took him home for the night I remember him telling me he was itchy.  about 15 hours after that, 67 hours ago she saw him at a local store picking up medication.  When she asked what it was he apparently said, \\\"oh, my doctor said I've got chiggers or something\\\" and she looked at the medicine he was prescribed and called me at work to look it up.  The medication was Permethrin Cream, 5%.  I looked it up and found out it was for scabies treatment.  Within the next day, he was apparently very badly broken out; within the next day and a half following that his girlfriend, my girlfriend's daughter with whom he's had considerable contact with, was broken out and my girlfriend  had complained the night before had an itchy bump on her hip.  That evening my girlfriend and her daughter went to the doctor and were tentatively diagnosed with also being infested with scabies. A skin scrape was done on each but the labs haven't come back yet as it was a Thursday and they were told it would be at least 3-4 days before the lab results came back.  Both have lived in the same apartment since the news and have been in contact with many things in the apartment.  Since it was immediately after/during the move-in many thing were still yet unpacked.  A lot of the large furniture had been moved around (many times to see how it looked) by the boyfriend and two other people at the same time, as well as me and my girlfriend separately on the last occasion (the one he told me he itched badly as he left).  For three nights I slept with my girlfriend there.  The night before they went to the doctor we had about 20 minutes contact where she manually stimulated me with lubrication and held each other off and on throughout the night.  I was home very little after the initial move to help move things around and touched very few things after I got home late at night after waking up, but I did move the furniture (suede-like cover) and only wore clothes that the original infested person did not touch.  There were, however, things (clothes and otherwise) in our bedroom he did carry that were on the carpet.  I showered in a hot shower, as I always do, every morning before and after this became evident.

I applied the cream fairly thinly except my hands, arms, feet, ankles and genitals (as we had had prolonged contact at that point the night before).

You have mentioned almost all of the details very nicely. Your physician was right in saying that the MRI donot show a seizure discharges and its only the EEG which shows seizure discharges. If EEG is showing it, there is no doubt why you shouldn't be on anti epileptic. Valproate and levetiracetam are two good anti epileptics and you should try them if not recovering. If symptoms do not improve with them, only then some antipsychotics may help you. Now that you are in India, we would advice you to take a neurologist consultation in India with all your old records. What you have not mentioned in your account is what medications are you currently on. In case if you are not on any medication, do start the anti-epileptic as soon as possible.

I had not eaten so I ordered for some food then that seemed settled. However 3 hours down the line I was not feeling dizzy but rather as if people were far.

I had not eaten so I ordered for some food then that seemed settled. However 3 hours down the line I was not feeling dizzy but rather as if people were far. I could hear people talking, they are near me, but I could hear as if they were far away. We dropped business for the evening and went to hospital: Aga Khan, Mombasa. Tests on Malaria , pressure yielded nothing. But the feeling never went. It was a strange feeling like losing balance, it was originating may be from the stomach, my neck was also a bit painful, I would feel my hand moving involuntarily occasionally. When I went finally to see a doctor after going through extra malaria drugs, I was given Stugeron to control the imbalance and something for the neck pain ...cartilaginous stuff (prescribed by an orthopaedist). 6 months down the line there was still no change. I would now find it difficult to attend meetings as my head would be full, I would not talk for long as I developed anger feelings etc. (I was a strong theatre person, play director and master of ceremonies) so everyone started getting worried. My physician sent me for an EEG (that brain thing) and the EEG was indicative of a generalized epileptiform discharge. I was not comfortable in a crowded place, a noisy place etc. Do not forget my weight was also over board so Type II was at the corner. My stomach still remained a problem and the physician concluded that it could be gastro intestinal epilepsy but could not confirm. He none the less put me on epilim . I went to see a neuro-surgeon in March 2007 in Aga Khan University hospital in Nairobi to seek a second opinion. He performed a brain scan using NMR or MRI? That noisy tube. I had to be there under mild anaesthesia because I could not lie still due to that imbalance. And he ordered for all tests under the moon on my blood and body organs. HIV was negative but he said diabetes was positive though my sugar levels were 6 to 7. His optician gave me specs. I went to Aga Khan seeing normally. Liver, spleen heart, ear etc were ok. All tests in the brain were negative. He performed an EEG but I never saw the results. He discontinued Epilim. Then he brought a dietician who insisted I lose weight. She proposed a diet for a 10 year old and prescribed 1000 mg glucophage (500 in the morning and 500 in the evening). My stomach problem which was a source of my imbalance was still there. We have come to realize it was acidity. But again it is NOT!! This treatment for 3 months kept my sugar at starvation levels of 4 to 6. The lab technician who was measuring my sugar once in Mombasa refused to buy the diabetes story and insisted that if it is true then for such levels, a diet control and not medication is enough. One evening after seeing my blood sugar at 4.7 he called and told me not to take the medicine. Infact he insisted that this diet plus the medicine will interfere with my internal body organs as they were not necessary. I e\u2013mailed my sugar levels to my first physician who is a diabetes expert. He asked me to see him urgently the following day and wondered why I had not collapsed. I explained to him what happened in Aga Khan NRB etc. He pulled me out of glucophage. Then after 2 weeks, my stomach just started feeling empty as if it was hollow. The imbalance due to stomach hollowness and was unbearable. I was back on a 500mg tablet of gluophage. He pulled me out of the diet as well. He performed a glucose tolerance test and realized my sugar was low and needed to be brought up. He put me on glucobay whose side effects is gas. Sugar went up as fasting was now 5.8 to 6.4 but post prandial (2 hr after dinner) would be 9 to 11. Now 2 things happened: Gas became a problem and the imbalance was not going away.

I went back to the neurosurgeon who sent me to a gastroenterologist since the brain according to his tests, some sent as far as Germany was OK. The gastroenterologist advised substitution of glucobay to reduce gas.. I went back to glucophage. He gave me Mebiz and Senokot for the stomach. I was still uncomfortable. I was working from home. In 2008 August, I made my first trip to Nairobi on official duty. We used our office car. I reached but that effect of not being comfortable in a crowd was there. Remember I am off Epilim still. We are dealing with mild diabetes. One week after returning to Mombasa, the feeling of that strange imbalance and hyper acidity in the stomach and gas returned. (Oily diet in Nairobi probably). I went to my physician. He referred me for another EEG. It was still indicative of generalized epileptiform discharge!! We were wrong to stop epilim but the MRI or NMR never showed. The physician said EEG deals with reactions, MRI is just photos!!With that he gave Epilim Chrono which Iwas still on till 2010-. I went to work the following day and have been there since. I went to the gastroenterologist to sort out this acidity and gas problem. He thought of Irritable bowel syndrome. He did a colonscopy, saw a polyp in the colon that was benign. My physician said IBS symptoms are far from what I have. He feels had we been on Epilim all that time, we could be far since such treatments take 3 years!!!! My gastroenterologist has sent me to another neurologist for another EEG to be sure. I have not gone. I am tired. The problem I have now is the slight imbalance, being unable to talk much and that gas here and there but I am improving. Now you see why I cannot use a mobile phone for long. The condition according to my physician is \u201cComplex partial seizure\u201d expressed in the gut and My gastroenterologist thinks it is Irritable bowel syndrome. I am not on a diet but only avoid sugar, oil, salt. Was advised to use vegetable salad as fillers. Recently (April 2009) I was in Bondo for a retreat for 4 days. We came by air. So I avoid places. I had never been admitted before, was never on medication etc. Have you given up? No my last neurosurgeon also ruled out epilepsy. He put me on Olanzapin because anytime now I would hear music from radio, laptop etc I would feel my head getting very full and very uncomfortable. This is worse for music from a laptop or computer till now. When I wear a trouser that fits a bit tightly, my head gets full. Nothing should touch the stomach. I was given neuro-forte and got a relief. But the problem is back. WHAT WAS NEURO-FORTE RELIEVING? THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I have now come for a conference in India with the same problem.\",\n        \"email\": \"dcgmhm@outlook.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"9881745606\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 236869,\n        \"Description\": \"Suggest treatment for bipolar disorder\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello thanks for asking from HCM I have read your detailed explanation of symptoms and can understand your problem.

I have a Dr willing to prescribe some home health care for me for some physical therapy and iv nutrician because of a possible eating disorder that i have developed due to everything that has been gpoing on in the past few months. I have servere Agroaphobia, social anxiety, PTSD, and panic attacks so as we speak i am notable to leave my home. my kids are with my mom because right now physically im not able to take care of them. Dfacs has a home parenting aid that comes out on a weekly basis, and i have been working with a CBT on-line councelor for a little over 2 months now. I have lost alot of weight gone from 289lbs to 215lbs since the end of June because I am unable to eat, I dont really have an appetite. I can small food think oh yummy and not eat. I am very weak because I have lost so much weight. I have some mobile atrophy going on, i am unable to climb the stairs or even remotely able to get out of bed because of how much weight i have lost it causes shortness of breathe if if i sit up or try to walk. Parts of my belly are numb because of how immobilzed i am, I am needing some in-home physical therapy and iv nutrician to get my strength back up. I can not do a peg feeding tube because of my attacks or i would so i have been told doing iv nutrician would be the best way to get it back up to where i can feel better in order to go back on my medications, stil work with the CBT therapist and the parent aid, and the dentist that is going to be working with me on a new guard for my TMJ. My nurse practionier is willing to do PPN (in-home iv nutrician threw the home health,) but she does not know enough about the dosages to write the script to have it done. She asked me to contact the Atlanta center for eating disorders to see if there is a nutricionist that can possibly help us in writing the orders and helping us with this.

Many people with eczema develop dry, itchy, red patches of skin. In some forms of eczema, blisters develop. Scratching can inflame the rash and cause \u201cweeping\u201d of clear fluid. Over time, the affected patches of skin can thicken. Eczema can look different depending on the type of rash and where it appears on the body. Symptoms typically flare up for a period of time and then calm down before surfacing again. More than 30 million Americans have some form of eczema. While the exact cause is unclear, a combination of factors, such as genes, environment, and immune system are thought to play a roleAtopic dermatitis is the most common form of the skin condition, and it\u2019s usually what people are referring to when they talk about eczema. About one in five children develop atopic dermatitis, often in infancy and usually by age 5. (Only a small percentage of adults develop this type of eczema.)Dry, scaly, red, and itchy patches can appear on the face, scalp, hands, or feet; inside the elbows; or behind the knees. In more severe cases, these patches crack and crust over, and they can become infected. Atopic dermatitis comes and goes, with periods when symptoms are worse and other times when the rash goes into remission and disappears. It tends to occur in families with a history of this eczema, hay fever, or asthma. It can be a lifelong condition, although some children outgrow it or see symptom improvement as they age. Eczema is usually accompanied by uncontrollable itching that worsens when you scratch it and can interfere with sleep. People sometimes scratch until they bleed, yet itching persists, and the wound becomes vulnerable to infection.The signs and symptoms of eczema can vary from one person to the next.Atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema, usually strikes in childhood. Babies tend to develop a red rash on their cheeks and scalp that turns dry and scaly. The rash can bubble up, ooze, and crust over. In young children, other body sites may be affected, such as the inside folds of the elbows or knees, or the hands, wrists, or feet. Over time, these patches can lighten or darken, and they may become thick and bumpy and constantly itchy.Dyshidrotic eczema typically strikes the hands and feet. People with this type of eczema develop small, fluid-filled blisters that itch and burn. The blisters weep, crust over, and crack, exposing the skin to painful infection.There\u2019s no single test for diagnosing eczema.", "start_char_idx": 321909, "end_char_idx": 326198, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe087aa2-b70f-4bec-ac66-48980d821f14": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe087aa2-b70f-4bec-ac66-48980d821f14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8738771-dea3-4573-b513-7a164205e1ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "a5606c863b1e3cd1ee29de7ac3edd65a372f6a1cf25040064577e9f2e7b4ca58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "544a932e-c4eb-4c8b-83b4-ce72b5948c48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4e9e4e4556ee2a6ead0809e3a42f41c2ef44bb674d4151fbf71fa3bc3a2771e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Babies tend to develop a red rash on their cheeks and scalp that turns dry and scaly.

The blisters weep, crust over, and crack, exposing the skin to painful infection.There\u2019s no single test for diagnosing eczema. Your doctor or your child\u2019s pediatrician will conduct a physical exam. Some patients may be referred to a dermatologist or allergist. Doctors look for typical signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching and rash.The difficulty is often ruling out other conditions that cause irritating skin symptoms. Atopic dermatitis, for example, may be confused with seborrheic dermatitis (a common condition that mainly affects the scalp), while nummular eczema may resemble ringworm (a contagious fungal infection). Sometimes a skin patch test or allergy test may be required to confirm an eczema diagnosis by ruling out other conditions.Expect your doctor to ask about your family history of allergic disease, since eczema can run in families. Kids with eczema can also go on to develop food allergy, hay fever (also known as allergic rhinitis), and asthma\u2014usually in that order (this is sometimes called the \u201catopic march\u201d).Tell your doctor when symptoms first appeared, how often you or your child experiences symptoms, other body parts that are affected, whether the problem comes and goes, and when it seems to flare up. Your doctor may ask about any allergies you or your child have and potential triggers of symptoms.Unfortunately, there\u2019s no single magic bullet to get rid of eczema. But there are a number of treatments and strategies for relieving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and preventing flare-ups. These include ointments and creams that are applied to the skin, oral antibiotics or antihistamines, and an injectable medication.Restoring moisture is crucial for preventing symptom flare-ups. Soaks and wet wraps can soothe pain and itching. Prescription and over-the-counter moisturizers can help repair dry skin and keep it hydrated.Steroid ointments and creams have long been the go-to remedy to clear up eczema rash. These topical treatments (also called corticosteroids) can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms during a flare-up. But they are not recommended for long-term use due to serious potential side effects. Topical steroids come in different strengths, so if one doesn\u2019t do the job, your doctor may switch to a more potent version.Newer non-steroidal medicines called calcineurin inhibitors are another option. These drugs include Elidel (pimecrolimus) cream for mild-to-moderate eczema and Protopic (tacrolimus) ointment is approved for moderate-to-severe symptoms.Eucrisa (crisaborole) ointment 2% is another option for eczema patients 2 years old and older. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2016, Eucrisa inhibits an enzyme that promotes inflammation.The newest weapon against eczema, approved in March 2017, is Dupixent (dupilumab) for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It is administered as an injection under the skin and is intended for people whose eczema is not controlled by topical therapies or for whom topical treatment isn\u2019t recommended. The active ingredient in Dupixent is an antibody that blocks a protein that causes inflammation.Light therapy (also called phototherapy) using a special device that emits ultraviolet light is an option for clearing difficult-to-treat eczema and rashes that are dispersed across the body.Topical products containing coal tar or antihistamines may be prescribed for itch relief.An antibiotic may be given to treat bacterial skin infections. Diluted bleach baths are sometimes used to treat baby eczema that results in frequent infections.

I suggest you not to worry much. OCD is a mental disorder of course, but that is not severe one. The cure to the OCD lies on your attitude towards the disorder and working with your psychologist and psychiatrist. Many researches and researchers confirm that medicines alone cannot cure mental disorders. Life style changes, change in thinking pattern, relaxation etc are as essential as medicines. Psychotherapy can help you changing your lifestyle and thinking patterns. Yoga and meditation help you to streamline your metabolism and neurological balance. Please consult a psychologist for further information. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is one way to address the issue along with logo therapy. In any case you should learn to ignore those obsessive thoughts, which is possible only if you distract yourself. Play games, write, read, do what ever, be busy. Slowly being busy becomes a habit.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

before.Intensity sometimes reduces but cocentration problem was very big.But one thing when I had under treatment there was no tensions with me.always happy whatever the situation is.I was carrying large number of backpapers at at that time.As per my old character I wouldhave come across suicide going through these kind of academic failures.I was not at all sad.After 4 years parents planned for marrige.in between I have gone through an affair.But fortunately came out of it suddenly.After B.Tech I had a crush with  one of my best friend.He too loved me a lot.He knew everything about me.about my disease.and all.But my family is against it because of caste problem.so we are  moving as friends itself.Now my condition is very worse.Now my whole life is flowing in OCD.I feel guilt  of my intrusive thoughts.I cant speak properly thinking how tongue is twisting very fast as our wish.sound and shadow problems are still there.Guilty problem is one of my present big problem.not only that  very very very bad  thoughts that even cant told to a doctor.sometimes feel to call bad words to people.sometimes dont feel to step down in the stop while I am in bus.lot of thoughts and behaviours are disturbing my life daily.I have forgotten the days I smiled from the mind.Now What my rule is to whomever I speak I shold tell my whole life story.otherwise I feel guilt.my relatives dont know about my disease and not everyone know about backpapers.but I feel guilt in hiding it.and I used to tell sometimes when I am not able to control.and my parents are in very depressed stage due to my behaviour.They dont know what to do.Now I am consulting one good psychologist.Doctor said,it isbetter not to take the medicine thinking about the side effects.I was in good shape in my study time. .Now I became very fat after having the treatment.My thoughts are disturbibg me very much.With great confidence I am trying to jump out of it.but not able to do so.I am not able to control myself.When

On the follow-up of 23-2-2012 he was again admitted, doctors sent him to MRI test (report attached).Prescription was given from a visiting doctor Dr. Mudukanna M.D.(General Medicine). AKT-4 Ultracet Pentab-40 Nervigin P Bevon plus Threptin protein biscuits Smuth (for constipation) By this time my father was very weak weighing only 38 kgs. With the start of AKT-4, he started vomiting, uneasiness was there, coundnot cope up with this. I contacted Dr. S.H. Katti (Former joint director,Health), he is a T.B. specialist and close friend of my father in law Prof Vasant Kushtagi (Elder brother of Dr Pralhad Kushtagi). Dr. Katti has given the treatment for cox From 27-2-2012 to 10-3-2012 AKT4 (Thirteen days) (Solapur) Dr Katti\u2019s treatment From 11-3-2012 to 27-5-2012 Forecox 150 and Omnacortil-5, Both twice a day Tapering dose was started on 28-5-2012 with Monto-3 and Omnacortil-5 Once a day Tablet Omnacortil was discontinued after 15 days of tapering. All the other general health medicines were properly maintained along with Monto \u2013 3. In the month of March, my father was very weak, but recovered and was stable. Pain was there but undercontrol. In April, He used to sit upto half an hour with the help of brace on his waste. He could stand and walk 4-5 steps with the help of walker. Beginning of the new Problem. My father was alright and there was no fresh complaints. Just eight days after starting of tab Monto-3, he started suffering from intense pain in lumber area and pain was spread to buttocks also. Calf muscle of right leg was paining a little. Even small leg movements were painful and difficult. I consulted Dr. Katti. He sought an orthopedic opinion on this and referred to Dr. Ramakant Kulkarni MS (ortho). He examined my father and found that there was no neural deficit. After studying MRI , he expressed doubt of pyogenic abscess in the vertebral body of L5-S1 (Just one doubt).He advised us to put the patient on Amakacin 0.5gm and magnis 1 gm for 10 days intravenous, also referred this to neurosurgeon Dr.Shashank Ramdurg, M.Ch Neurosurgery presently working in Basaveshwar hospital Gulbarga. Dr Shashank carefully examined MRI reports but said this must be TB only. He immediately contacted Dr. Chetan Durgi MD Radiologist for opinion. Radiologist said that in Indian conditions this is 99% TB only.Monto-3 was continued. After 3-4 days of intravenous injection of amakacin and magnis, evening rise of temperature was not there, But on 9th day it relapsed. On communication with doctors , they said this I.V. can be continued for 14 days. Even after completion of 14 days, there was no respite from the problem. We family members decided to take the patient to Ashwini multi superspeciality hospital in Solapur.

They retained the patient for four days from 31-7-12 to 4-8-12. Injections Eldcef and pantocid were given twice a day through i.v. A Repeat MRI was done (Second report attached). Actually infection was increased and abscess in the L5-S1 was slightly increased. There were lengthy discussions among doctors. Discussion with Neurosurgeon: Even after putting the patient on antituberculosis drugs for five months, patient did not responded much. This is the fit case for surgery and grafting of L5- S1. But the patient age is above 80 and the risk ratio is very high as the operation is a real major one. Only conservative therapy can be continued. Discussion with physician: The dosage given for TB i.e; forecox 150 was too less for the patient. The sense of well being was due to omnacortil. TB is curable. In his long experience, he has seen patients like this and adjusted the dosage of medicines. Again AKT-4 regime was started along with L-Cin 750, Ultracet- semi for pain, Grenill for fever and tab ketadol if there is intense pain. I was not satisfied and requested doctors to drain the abscess by C.T. guided aspiration as this is feasible for the patient. In C.T. scan room radiologist Dr Iyer was present for this procedure. He took some C.T cuts on his monitor, analyzed and told me that the abscess is on the other side bone and is hardly one ml(1 ml).There is a dirty tissue around it, It is not possible for the needle to reach from the back. Only two bones of the vertebra are involved, there is no need to drain the abscess as it will heal once the infection subsides. After this they discharged the patient. Next follow-up is on 4th September. This is all the story. At present my father is in Sedam. There is no fever now. He is taking all the medicines regularly. While getting up he feels pain and can sit for only 4-5 minutes. Quality of life is affected. Morale is low. I have few questions. 1. When my father will come out from the burden of this spine TB infection? 2. Whether the path followed by the doctors is correct? 3. What improvements in medicines can be made for fast recovery? 4.

Dust, smog, secondhand smoke or strong odors, such as perfumes, can trigger nonallergic rhinitis. Chemical fumes, such as those you might be exposed to in certain occupations, also may be to blame. 2)  Weather changes. Temperature or humidity changes can trigger the membranes inside your nose to swell and cause a runny or stuffy nose. 3)  Infections. A common cause of nonallergic rhinitis is a viral infection \u2014 a cold or the flu, for example. This type of nonallergic rhinitis usually clears up after a few weeks but can cause lingering mucus in the throat (postnasal drip). Sometimes, this type of rhinitis can become chronic, causing ongoing discolored nasal discharge, facial pain and pressure (sinusitis). 4)  Foods and beverages. Nonallergic rhinitis may occur when you eat, especially when eating hot or spicy foods. Drinking alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine, also may cause the membranes inside your nose to swell, leading to nasal congestion. 5)  Certain medications. Some medications can cause nonallergic rhinitis. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), and high blood pressure (hypertension) medications, such as beta blockers. Nonallergic rhinitis can also be triggered in some people by sedatives, antidepressants, oral contraceptives or drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction. Overuse of decongestant nasal sprays can cause a type of nonallergic rhinitis called rhinitis medicamentosa. 6)  Hormone changes. Changes in hormones due to pregnancy, menstruation, oral contraceptive use or a hormonal condition such as hypothyroidism can cause nonallergic rhinitis. 7)  Stress. Emotional or physical stress can trigger nonallergic rhinitis in some people.  Some treatments include: 1)  Saline nasal sprays. Use an over-the-counter nasal saline spray or homemade saltwater solution to flush the nose of irritants and help thin the mucus and soothe the membranes in your nose. 2)  Corticosteroid nasal sprays. If your symptoms aren't easily controlled by decongestants or antihistamines, your doctor may suggest a prescription corticosteroid nasal spray, such as fluticasone (Flonase) or mometasone (Nasonex). Corticosteroid medications help prevent and treat inflammation associated with some types of nonallergic rhinitis. Possible side effects include indigestion, nausea, headache and bodily pains. 3)  Antihistamine nasal sprays. Try a prescription antihistamine spray such as azelastine (Astelin) and olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase). While oral antihistamines don't seem to help nonallergic rhinitis, antihistamine in the form of a nasal spray may reduce symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis. Side effects may include a bitter taste in your mouth, headache and fatigue. 4)  Anti-drip anticholinergic nasal sprays. The prescription drug ipratropium (Atrovent) is often used as an asthma inhaler medication. But it's now available as a nasal spray and can be helpful if a runny, drippy nose is your main symptom. Side effects may include a bitter taste in your mouth and drying of the inside of your nose. 5)  Oral decongestants. Available over-the-counter or by prescription, examples include pseudoephedrine-containing drugs (Actifed, Sudafed, others) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, others). These medications help narrow the blood vessels, reducing congestion in the nose. Possible side effects include high blood pressure, insomnia, loss of appetite, heart pounding (palpitations), anxiety and restlessness. 6)  Decongestant nasal sprays. These include oxymetazoline (Afrin, others).", "start_char_idx": 346559, "end_char_idx": 350632, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64ad397c-df06-4196-9b41-335b9e0ba417": {"__data__": {"id_": "64ad397c-df06-4196-9b41-335b9e0ba417", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89a586fa-5518-451a-9e41-6c4d8cce4829", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "832961a568e372c87a62d80ab9682b40c5278e906ef50376ec5eea9fc3efd2c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68a6c49c-1b73-48cd-84c7-0b237d246127", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a047b53377f30c2bae05c9cd02c66698d35fb092c6034d8547dfe3195449b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The prescription drug ipratropium (Atrovent) is often used as an asthma inhaler medication.

Other possible side effects include headache, insomnia and feeling nervous.  Complications from nonallergic rhinitis include:  1)  Nasal polyps. These are soft, noncancerous (benign) growths that develop on the lining of your nose or sinuses due to chronic inflammation. Small polyps may not cause problems, but larger ones can block the airflow through your nose, making it difficult to breathe. 2)  Chronic sinusitis. Prolonged nasal congestion due to nonallergic rhinitis may increase your chances of developing sinusitis \u2014 an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses. When sinusitis lasts for longer than 12 consecutive weeks, it's referred to as chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis causes pain, tenderness and swelling around your eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead.  There are certain things that you can do for yourself to help reduce discomfort and relieve the symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis:      \u2022  Rinse your nasal passages. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle, such as the one included in saline kits (Sinus Rinse, others), bulb syringe or neti pot to rinse your nasal passages. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help to keep your nose free of irritants. When used daily, this is one of the most effective treatments for nonallergic rhinitis. Use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller to make up the irrigation solution. Also be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with similarly distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water and leave open to air dry.      \u2022  Blow your nose. Regularly and gently blow your nose if mucus or irritants are present.      \u2022  Humidify. Set up a humidifier in your work or sleep location. Or breathe in the steam from a warm shower to help loosen the mucus in your nose and clear your head of stuffiness.       \u2022  Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of liquids, such as water, juice or noncaffeinated tea. Avoid caffeinated beverages, which can cause dehydration and aggravate your symptoms  Contact your family physician with your concerns and complications.  Together devise a strategy to eliminate your disease process.

Why do I become alert and aware during surgery inspite of anesthesia?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello. I have read your past experiences of conscious sedation, and I understand how difficult it would have been for you. One thing I want to clear you first is that conscious sedation does not mean general anesthesia. Conscious sedation works on this principle only that you or the patient is conscious. It may decrease the pain and increase the cooperation for the procedure, but it does not mean that you will not hear or feel anything. For small oral surgeries and small procedures, everywhere conscious sedation is used. It just means that it will decrease to some extent your feeling of pain and you might be sedated for most of the procedure time but not the whole time of the procedure. It means one can recall so many things from surgery in conscious sedation. If you want to be completely knocked down and not feel or listen anything then what you need is general anesthesia which is usually not given for small procedures. Now coming to your problem. First, you need to discuss with your anesthesiologist better a day or few days before the surgery explaining him everything what happened in past surgeries and what you expect from him. If you will discuss this with your anesthetist a few days earlier or at least a day before, he will not think that you are just afraid of OR (operating room). You have to make your mind and explain it to him that whether you want conscious sedation or general anesthesia. If you do not want to feel anything and not want to be awake in between the procedure, explain to him that you want general anesthesia and no sedation. Explain it to him clearly what are your experiences from past and what you expect from him this time in procedure. Regarding the recording thing, let me ask you a question. Do you never talk to your colleague whenever you were doing your thesis or research work? I guess everybody does. It is routine work for them, so it is not possible that everybody is keeping silence during work. Have you never met a little difficult person to handle? The next thing I want to tell you is that keeping a recorder during the procedure is like interfering into someone else's privacy. It may have legal implications for you. Next, it is affecting your mental peace too. You are doing something which is increasing your sufferings more. Just answer one question, if you get a scary dream, is it good to have any horror dream repeated in your mind again and again or is it better to forget one. The choice is yours. Telling some patient to calm down during a procedure is a type of psychotherapy, and it has been proven effective. It is not that the person wants to give you less drug, the problem with conscious sedation is that you have to limit the dosage of the drug or else the patient will stop breathing, and that is not what you or the doctor wants. So, better ask for general anesthesia. Last but not the least, consult a psychotherapist or psychiatrist regarding your past awareness of anesthesia. The sessions will help you remove or at least decrease the mental trauma from past episodes.

Before asking my question, I need to provide some background and context. I have had many surgeries and am a well-educated (Ph.D.) person. I am not a typical patient, given my knowledge, background, etc., including the fact that I get a copy of my complete chart for each surgery or medical procedure using any form of sedation or anesthesia. I am knowledgeable about most drugs used during anesthesia and how they work. I have been told by a surgeon (included in his surgical report) and two dentists that I require a lot of anesthesia. I have had multiple bad experiences with anesthesia, primarily conscious sedation. In my last surgery, I became alert, aware and had full memory of the second, third and fourth stitch. I have experienced pain and awareness or memory during other oral surgeries and other procedures. I abhor the idea of conscious sedation, and the drug versed, specifically, except when used for induction. I have had my specific verbal and written expectations violated. This has all lead to both fear of some simple procedures (like oral surgery and even regular dentistry) and a distrust that I will be cared for in a manner that I do not find acceptable. Two days ago, I had oral surgery and had some memory of pain and other things and, because of my experience, I am also a person that brings a high-quality recorder into the procedure room or OR (when the opportunity presents itself). So, for the oral surgery two days ago, I recall experiencing pain and asking for more medication. I recall being told to calm down (the audio recording supports these recollections, plus the oral surgeon and anesthesiologist, who I paid extra out-of-pocket to have available so I could be in deep sedation and not experience pain. Note to all anesthesiologists and surgeons; patients can sometimes hear and remember everything you say. Be respectful, at least in the presence of the patient. I had recalled something like this but was not certain exactly what was said until I listened to the recording. Okay, my question is this is a short and long-term question. I have a procedure with the anesthesiologist at 8 AM. He also does some pain management procedures, and I will be getting the nerve block test for lumbar RFA tomorrow. I will have a CRNA who will be doing the anesthesia or sedation. But, I want to be able to discuss what happened to me during oral surgery with the anesthesiologist. I am a bit upset about that. I have a fear of dental and other painful procedures. I know that the local anesthetics do not work as well on me as they do on others which is presumably why I was feeling pain and this is an issue not just for the procure in the morning. It is an ongoing issue that just grows more intense with every procedure that my trust is violated, and I experience pain and, I need the RFA. I have multiple herniated discs and arthritis, facet joint damage. I do not know how to articulate my needs in such a way that the anesthesiologist or CRNA (later this morning or in the future) takes my concerns seriously. I do not just need something to calm me, and in fact, the very thing that an anesthesiologist would use to calm me is one of the most fearful things to me. I do not want to experience pain. I do not need amnesia, and I do not need to be calm (well, I would be calm if these things did not repeatedly happen to me). I just need no pain and if that takes a heavier dose of Propofol (in a hospital setting). So be it. If that takes more local anesthetic. So be it. I need to be unconscious, or I need enough pain management and deep sedation or no sedation. What do I need to say to get that without offending or getting interpreted as just another person who is afraid of the OR (which I am not) and, I am pretty sure that they would be freaked out if I told them that I bring a recorder in with me (for additional curiosity, if that is not something that I want to share.

I will try to solve most of your problems, if not all.Firstly, the heaviness in the center of chest and upper abdomen with minimal exertions; swelling of the lower torso during the day, is STRONGLY suggestive of failing of the entire heart along with co-existing coronary artery disease. Investigations like 2-D Echo, stress TMT/Thallium test and coronary angiography will confirm my views. Medicines like digoxin, diuretics, low-dose alpha-beta blockers (such as carvedilol), coronary vasodilators in adequate doses and ACE inhibitors in titrated doses will certainly help you.Further, the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (also called Sick Sinus Syndrome, which is part of the manifestations of Myotonic dystrophy) can be kept under control on anti-arrhythmic drug, such as, amiodarone and, ideally a dual chamber pacemaker.Difficulty in opening fingers after sustained squeezing of fingers, as well as, transient ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), is also part of the symptoms of Myotonic Dystrophy. Perhaps, serum Potassium estimation should be periodically.Since the disease primarily affects the muscles, the intestinal smooth muscles too tend to get involved, leading to bloating, constipation, poor digestion. Perhaps, pro-kinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide + omeprazole will be of some help.For osteoporosis, adequate calcium + Vit D3 (1000mcg) daily intake will of significant benefit.Lastly, may I inform you that it is a genetic disease and has NO TREATMENT. Only symptomatic treatment can be given to relieve different problems associated with the condition.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion/recommendations and treatment. I am certain that he will agree  with my opinion and clinical acumen;  order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable treatment as advised. If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating to my answer, to encourage all doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

It feels like my stomach has been replaced with a brick--it feels weighty. I also get mildly nauseated, and it doesn t matter if I have eaten or not. It happens on an empty stomach as much as it does on a full stomach. It feels as if I ve eaten a huge meal and can t catch my breath, even if I haven t. There is also pain that I would rate anywhere between a 3 and a 6. The pain can also extend to closer to where the pancreas is, and while I have had a few cases of acute pancreatitis in the past, my blood work has not shown to be positive for it since 1996. The other mysterious thing that nobody seems to have an answer to is that I wake up in the morning with a thin lower torso, but I put a few inches on in fluid throughout the day. This is not ascites - it is all in the tissue, under the skin, surrounding my abdomen and back. This has happened every single day for the last five years, and is also worse upon exertion. High temperature can bring it on and exacerbate it too. It s so frustrating, and I have been called a hypochondriac numerous times. I was even yelled at by an ER physician when I went in with extreme PACs and a combo of bradycardia & tachycardia that wouldn t abate - something that occurs a few times a year and that makes me have to go into the ER for i.v. Lopressor. These are the things I know for sure (and I ve been tested for many, many things). I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, Ptosis (which is worse first thing in the morning but usually goes away after time), and I sometimes get these little painful blisters on my upper abdomen, under breasts, on my knees and elbows. They are red and full of liquid and very painful. They last just one or two days, and then they are little painful scabs. They flare up fairly often - usually I get them once or twice a month. Cholesterol is 240 (I ve brought it down from 283 with diet change and fish oil). I have some connective tissue issues (hypermobility and possibly Ehlers Danlos, which my daughter was diagnosed with too) and possibly Sjogren s Syndrome (Schirmer test result is 0 and I get frequent salivary gland pain and swelling, very dry mouth, and several other symptoms) although ANA tests are negative. I had a spot removed from my chest which was positive for Lupus, however, a subsequent biopsy on normal skin from the same area was negative. I also have frequent inflammation of the medial epicondyle and it s quite painful, and painful swelling in other joints. Tests for inflammation are also negative but I was diagnosed with arthritis. I have, what a couple doctors have called Myotonia, but others dispute it. When I squeeze my hand tightly for several seconds, then relax, my fingers stay gripped. They will relax over time, or I can open them with my other hand. The doctor who diagnosed it was a primary care physician, and she observed my daughter and I both showing her, and she used the little hammer and tapped on the muscle near my thumb, which caused the thumb to cramp up. However, muscle testing was negative. I get a combination of PACs, bradycardia, and tachycardia, that leaves me unable to function because I have near-syncope when it happens. I have had three major episodes in the last twelve months or so that required ER trips and i.v. Lopressor to fix it.

I try but then ease up. I never forget the thoughts though... Every time I have to go to the bathroom to shit, there is blood and I can t tell my doctor or my mom. I have Phimosis, researched how to stretch the foreskin, but then am too lazy and just don t do it. I am addicted to sweets and feel obese. I am trying to stop sweets and it s hard. I want to workout and get that amazing body, but am too lazy and just don t. I tried intermittent fasting for a while. Also didn t work too well. I have bad facial skin and want no pimples or blackheads or anything. But I m too lazy to wash my face. I m 19 and have hardly any hair under my arms... It s probably not a big deal but it bothers me. I want to shave my pubic hair on my nut sack, but don t know how to without cutting my balls. I want to shave my ass but also don t know how to without slicing my ass up. All of that I know is done independently and through experience. I feel too lazy to even try and experiment. Even manscaping I feel too lazy to do sometimes. But I guess I m typing this to you for advice, help and anything else that I might need to be informed about. I know that I need help but I don t know what extent that help needs to be from. I feel like I don t even want to stop hurting myself. I just know that I have to. That it s not normal... I tried turning to God but I am not religious and don t believe in him. Please. Any help and advice or anything would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I don t want to send this message, but I know I have to. This tells me I feel that I don t want to get better. I just know that I need to.\",\n        \"email\": \"ltpggs@outlook.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"3218028908\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 244329,\n        \"Description\": \"Suffering with bipolar disorder, on T-Meat-50.

My parents took him back and they tested him and the sore on his leg had MRSA , therefore they started treating him for MRSA. Again he did not get better, and the finally did a ultrasound of his leg to discover he had a severe DVT from the knee to the ankle. He was therefore put on blood thinners which the DVT eventually did resolve and they were going to keep him on blood thinners for 6 months then take him off and do further testing to see what may have caused this in such a young, active young man. Then at the end of June my parents noticed he was having trouble breathing. When they asked him what was wrong, he said nothing initially, and as they observed him longer they realized he was really struggling to breathe. Therefore, they took him to the ER, and discovered he had a pericardial and pleural effusion . They drained the fluid and ran cytology tests on it which came back negative, but the color of the fluid was milky. They also created a pericardial window to drain the fluid off his heart. His white count was elevated and initially he had blood and high protein in his urine as well, which later cleared. They sent him home on a Sunday. Within 2 days he could not even get out of bed without heavy breathing and again he thought he was okay, so they took him back to the doctor. They did a chest x-ray to discover he had a massive effusion in his chest already. He was admitted and due to the severity they had to put a chest tube in each side and be had to be intubated to keep his oxygen levels up. They drained 2 L of fluid off one lung and 1 L off the other. His white count was elevated. They began running more tests on his heart, from echo to ultrasounds to many other tests. This showed his heart was working extra hard to pump. Eventually he stabilized was extubated still with tubes draining a lot, and they did an MR of his heart which showed his pericardium was thickened to 9 mm. They thought they would have to perform a pericardiectomy due to constrictive pericarditis . They did a heart cath to verify and it showed that his heart was constricted, and by the time they did the cath, his heart actually was pumping ok. The pericardium was still obviously thickened and showed some abnormalities; however was not constricting the heart, so they did not perform the pericardiectomy. They could not pull the chest tubes though as he was still putting out a lot of fluid, but now was clear, with a bloody-tinge. At this time his white counts started dropping as well as his hemoglobin. They ran several blood tests and discovered he was extremely protein malnourished (which is hard to believe as my brother is 6 foot 3 inches and weighs 300+ pounds). He was also severe anemia and had very low lymphocytes, monocytes. They tried iron supplementation and discovered this was making his iron levels worse. They even tried IV iron and still made his iron levels lower therefore they discontinued the iron. He was taking protein shakes for the protein, and this helped stabilize his protein levels. They also did a CT scan of his abdomen and discovered he has splenomegaly. His liver function tests were normal. His CRP and Sed rate were elevated. At this time, they transferred him to a higher level of care as they could not figure out what was going on with him. The University Medical Center ran even more tests, and said everytime they ran a test they ended up with more questions than answers. They were sure it was some kind of inflammatory condition such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis as my mom has rheumatoid; however all these tests came back negative. Rheumatology signed off on his case saying it was not a rheumatologic condition.

He still requires at least 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, but hospital had to send him home as that was his only requirement and insurance would not allow him to stay longer. One week after discharge of being in hospital for nearly 3 weeks total, he is still protein malnourished with anemia. His white cells are still extremely low. They ran immunoglobulin tests on him and discovered they were nearly non-existent. Therefore between his low white count and immunoglobulins, he has no immune system. His lungs have began filling up again in his lungs, and therefore the doctor put him on Lasix to help get rid of fluid. We will not know until next week if this seems to be helping. My parents believe it is helping with his breathing however his ankles are still swelling. He is still requiring his Oxygen. He also had a bone marrow test done, this came back negative for cancers. However, they did say they are still waiting for the iron studies of the bone marrow, but I am not sure what that will really show, except his iron deficiency. Everyone is at a loss as to what is going on. None has any answers and every doctor keeps passing the buck to another and now we are back to his primary care, which I am not confident at all he can handle this. To me it seems this is above so many doctors heads, we need to know where to go. We are treating symptoms as he is now on blood pressure medicines and a medicine to keep his heart rate down as it gets too high, and oxygen and Lasix. This is a 26-year-old, how can he live like this for life. There has to be someone who can help us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, or anything we can suggest they test for.

The other very apparent symptom is intense and sudden sweating. I m literary drenched with sweat. Also, I feel incredibly weak, slightly nauseous and intensely sick like I am dieing. I can t even get off the floor. Eventually these feeling fade within about 30-40 minutes after which time I feel still very sick but have enough energy to stand up. Then it might take 1-2 hours to feel normal again although sometimes when I have a really bad attack it can take 24 hours before I feel normal again. I ve seen a few doctors for this and one doctor said he thinks it was syncope. The other doctors just ran quite a few tests said their results were normal and never really got back to me. It didn t seem like they really new what was going on. I ve had ecocardiograms done and mri, both came back normal. I ended up just living with it for some several years until when I was about 27 one day for no real reason I bought some raw barley that I saw in the supermarket. It was just an impulse buy as I never noticed it before and thought it would be interesting to cook it like rice. I liked it a lot, but that day I became intensely sick maybe several hours after eating it. I had extreme diarrhea, repeated vomiting, and a general feeling of being sick. At the time I thought I had a stomach virus so I thought I would just stay at home and rest, but it kept getting worse and worse so I went to the doctor. The doctor thought I might have a stomach parasite since one of the blood tests indicated elevated eosinophil count but the stool test showed no parasite. She sent me to a hematologist, who ran more blood tests which showed nothing wrong and the eosinophil count dropping down to normal. By that time I was feeling better. That doctor just recommended contacting him again if symptoms return. They didn t for a long time until after several months I decided to finish eating the rest of the barley I had. The same symptoms returned. I haven t asked any doctor about it since but was just assuming that it was some strange allergic reaction. At about that same time I began noticing that I was beginning to feeling slightly itchy whenever I at spicy foods which I ate alot. I decided to stop eating barley and spicy foods and I noticed that my fainting spells stopped. I hadn t eaten spicy foods for a year and I haven t fainted since. About a year ago I decided to try to test it out for sure so I ate spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce and a few days later I had a fainting episode with the same symptoms. I assumed it was an allergic reaction and after having read a bit more I was assuming that all the time I was going into anaphylaxis. The only two symptoms I don t seem to have is swelling of my throat and hands as well as any rash or itching. The itching comes immediately after eating spicy foods and the anaphylaxis maybe a few days or several hours later. My question is the following, is this the likely diagnosis? And is there a simple definitive test to diagnose this? What type of doctor should I see? I ve also noticed a few years ago that I seem to also be allergic to tylenol after never having been before. I had pretty standard allergic reaction symptoms. My lips swelled up, I felt itchy, and difficulty breathing. It lasted for only a few minutes and went away. Since then I have been staying clear of barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol and it seems to work although I haven t seen a doctor about this allergic reaction guess for my past problems.

The after affects after the faint lasted all day this time and out of curiosity I took my temperature and it read 95.2 degrees F (oral). Thinking this low I decided to have a hot bath. After sitting in the bath for about a few minutes the nausea suddenly intensified and I spontaneously began to vomit multiple times. For some reason the bath made me really sick. Anyway I m committed to stay clear of cayenne pepper and be more careful in the future, but the reason why I wanted to ask a doctor about this now was because I wanted to know if you think I should have an epipen on hand. I was a little afraid as to how much more intense the symptoms were after having not had them for so long. I was wondering if you think I should get checked out again or if there is really no way to definitively confirm such an allergy. Also, from what I read barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol allergies are rare and also I don t experience every common allergy symptom. So I was wondering if you think I was wrong about this being an allergy or if this is indicative of some other type of unusual condition. I just didn t want to waste my time and money seeing another doctor about this again since I wasn t sure if there was going to be anything also they could test or do for me other than to advice staying clear of those foods for which I already know.\",\n        \"email\": \"zieves@yahoo.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"0055665169\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 124336,\n        \"Description\": \"Throbbing pain in abdomen, above belly button, feels like contractions.

General Data This is a case of a 27 year old female, single, Catholic from Samar, admitted for the first time due to severe throbbing headaches and enlargement of the abdomen. History of Present Illness Condition started 8 months PTA, when she suddenly felt severe throbbing headaches while lying down, occurring alternately between the right and left sides of the head, lasting approximately an hour with associated nausea. The pain would be slightly relieved by Paracetamol . This was also associated with blurring of vision. The patient was noted to have light perception , but other figures were described as \u201ccloudy\u201d. There was also notable enlargement of the abdomen prior to headaches, no change in the frequency of bowel movement (defecates every other day) as claimed by the patient. She denied of any intimate contact. Seven months PTA, the headache and nausea persisted, this time associated with dizziness. Symptoms progressed until 5 months PTA, when the patient consulted a neurologist . She was diagnosed to have an intracranial tumor. Ophthalmologic examination was also sought by the patient. She was also referred to a surgeon and gynaecologist for the evaluation of abdominal enlargement. There were episodes of difficulty in urination, more felt at the latter part of voiding. Four months PTA, consultation was done in another institution. A skull x-ray was taken and was found to be unremarkable. A cranial MRI examination was advised to patient but deferred due to financial constraints. 1 week PTA, the cranial MRI was eventually done and the patient was subsequently advised admission. Ultrasound of the abdomen was also done which revealed a large complex mass in the left ovary.

On the 2nd hospital day, nephrology consult was done for proteinuria. Ultrasound of the kidney, urinary bladder, liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, pancreas and spleen showed these organs to be normal. Ultrasound of the pelvic organs revealed an enlarged complex left ovarian mass. There was a low-grade fever with throbbing headaches notably milder than the 1st day. On the 4th hosp day, the throbbing headaches still persisted. CT scan revealed an extra-axial tumor with few calcification and cysts formation, probably benign. She was scheduled for CP clearance prior to surgery. On the 5th hosp day, the patient was still febrile, given antibiotics and antipyretics. A few hours later, the patient experienced headaches not relieved by NSAIDs. On the 7th hosp day, high grade fever recurred, notably drowsy, anasarcous with no significant change in the urine output. Blood chemistries showed hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia and elevated levels of AST. Potassium replacement was done. Insulin was also given. Few hours later, the patient became stuporous and hypotensive with coarse rales from mid to base on both lung fields. Dobutamine and epinephrine were started. She was subsequently intubated. On the 8th hosp day, the patient remained febrile and hypotensive. Furosemide was given and titrated due to further increasing abdominal girth and edema of the face and extremities. Fluconzaole 200mg/NGT OD was started.

In childhood, I had malaria and double typhoid. Everything was normal until few years back. Things started all over again since the last five to six years. I have been putting on weight continuously, suffering from weakness, horrible fatigue and body pain all the time. So, I was done with blood and thyroid tests. My TSH level was at 5.4 then. Doctor told it is at border level. Walking and good food would be enough to make it normal. Two years later of it, also nothing much changed instead symptoms worsened. Apart from the symptoms stated above, muscle cramps, low energy levels and irregular periods got started. This time, I was tested with whole body health checkup package. Results are stated below.\u00a0T3 138, T4 7.53 and TSH 6.89.\u00a0Through ultrasound scan peripherally placed small follicles got revealed in both ovaries, might be PCOD.\u00a0Creatinine serum/plasma 1.0, HDL cholesterol serum/plasma 36, LDL cholesterol serum/plasma 103, ALT (SGPT) serum/plasma 20, calcium serum 9.4, urine routine and specific gravity 1.005. These tests were done two years back. I have mentioned only the values which were not in the normal range specified. So, it was confirmed as the hypothyroid condition and I went on with homeopathy treatment. When I was done with thyroid profile test again in a year's time during the treatment, my results were\u00a0T3 112, T4 8.26 and TSH 4.15.\u00a0During the first month of the treatment, I felt slightly better. But, after that nothing changed. Doctors affirmed that there was an improvement, but I kept suffering from symptoms horribly. I had a test again a year back and the\u00a0results were\u00a0T3 140, T4 8.68 and TSH 4.92.\u00a0Though I learned from reports, that I am fine, nothing was actually changed. My quality of life has been ruined completely. Doctor suggested using vitamin D supplement Must D3 60K for three months. After using it also I did not get required energy to bring life on track again. Since the start of the treatment, I have joined in the gym and later did things like walking, exercise at home, proper diet but nothing had still changed. Seeing the symptoms persist, I lost motive in doing any of them. My treatment period was completed one year ago and I have given up on homeopathy.\u00a0Now I had done all tests once again, and would like to consult a physician. Please check the latest reports, which I have attached.\u00a0Before taking treatment again, I would wish to know the answers and have some knowledge from my few questions. So, it would be really helpful if you suggest solutions to them. My present and persistent symptoms and issues are as follows. I have hair dryness, hair fall and dandruff. I am getting dry cough while waking up from sleep sometimes in one-sided position sleep. It is like I wake up because of cough. I am unable to bear the weight of the head on the neck often. I was done with x-rays of neck for neck and shoulder pain. A numb ache persists all over neck and shoulders. Everything was normal there with x-rays. I have cold intolerance. I am getting joint pains too quickly. I am affected with cold easily. It always present each day around the year. I am\u00a0unable to lose weight how much ever I exercise. With or without exercise it remains the same. I was on 75 kg when I did the tests. After three months of exercise, I came to 71 kg, but again it went up to 74 kg. Now too it is the same.

I lose focus on things easily due to internal disturbance.\u00a0I am getting irritated easily these days. Even after sensing not to shout, I lash out at others and stay fuming for a long time. I am suffering from high mood swings and unpredictable moods. I feel happy and positive in one hour and suddenly nothing seems to change how much ever I try, getting sad in next hour. Again, I will end up boosting myself to keep going in next hour. The same goes on.\u00a0I am naturally ambitious since childhood. As my state affected my studies and made me unemployed, I get depressed few times. But, I still feel I am an optimistic person and do hard work with what I have. I am taking a lot of time to digest and accept change and decisions in life. I just lost\u00a0self-confidence completely to take any initiative in everything.\u00a0Cravings over specifically on ice creams, chocolates, sweets and samosas. It gets high during midnights. I had irregular menstrual pain.\u00a0They got corrected, but there is PMS pain, giddiness, irritability, etc. During periods, my back pain is very high. Now my periods has been delayed for 10 days.\u00a0I tried hard to push myself to walk half an hour daily. Then I tried exercises at home for an hour. Failing to push further, joined in the gym and did aerobics, strength training for about five to six months. I did breathing exercises regularly. And tried my best to make myself mentally strong.\u00a0I used B-complex and vitamin C supplements often for pains.\u00a0Now, I stopped everything and looking for proper medication and advice. I would like to start everything again with confidence.What is my exact condition? How worse it is? Is it only hypothyroidism or any other condition? If it is only hypothyroidism, why it did not show any improvement on the physical symptoms level?\u00a0I want to present all new present condition reports before the doctor. So which tests should I undergo?\u00a0Which specialty doctor should I consult who can treat these above conditions well?\u00a0Apart from doctors and treatment, what personal measures should I take? Which supplements can I take? Which foods can I take for energy boosting and to remain healthy? Which exercises can I do?\u00a0I am desperate for a proper solution for this, as it is affecting my career and personal life.\",\n        \"email\": \"hodlgh@gmail.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"1694057402\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 237129,\n        \"Description\": \"Suggest medication for anxiety and sleeplessness after nervous breakdown\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

I have beeen dealing with a lot of lack of sleep and disturbed sleep. I was always a little bit of a night hawk ; but only on the nights that I didn t have to get up really early in the morning. Anyways, the bottom line is for the last past while;say the last 2mo. straight I haven t been sleeping much. I blame it on hormones; but it s leaving me feeling very drained and lifeless. Their has been a lot of stress in the last few years; we nearly lost our daughter 2 yrs.ago due to an almost fatal car accident. My mom underwent a major heart surgery; a double by pass; our home has been under major rennovations and my husband travels so a lot of the time, I have to be both parent; mother and father. I still have a little one at home; she s in school but she s still young . I lost my father back in 2006; but in spite of it all; I ve always been really good about anything that came my way. Oh yeah; I ve been dealing with abnormal noncancerous cells in my cervical area. So far so good; but I m not out of the woods yet; I may have to undergo a partial hysterectomy depending on the results coming up this november. I ve always been a really happy, full of life who lived her life to the fullest kind a person. I ve always taken everything in stride. I was always a very easy going type of person. Anyways it s out of character for me to be going through this whatever this is. I hope it s just a phase and I can snap out of it soon. I m not happy right now and I m trying so hard to hide my feelings; because I wanted to believe that i could overcome it without anyone noticing; and that I could fight this depression that i m going through. Anyways, I ended up seeing a doctor recently a wk. ago; and she prescribed medication called Venlafaxine for 7 days; 1 tablet daily.After the week is over, I m suppose to double my dose. Well, Ive only taken it for 2 days, and Ive been experiencing no sleep from the medication and i developed an allergic reaction ; I ended up getting a severe case o hives. So now yesterday was the third day and I did not take the medication . Oh yes, I am also taking a natural, herbal formula 2x a day for my menopausal symptoms; and I am allergic to penicllin; so I don t know what to do. But the positive side was that I noticed how my mood and my emotional state had just changed after 2 days.

But the positive side was that I noticed how my mood and my emotional state had just changed after 2 days. I was much more happier the second day that i took Venlafaxine. I must tell you that a few years ago; when I was 45, I had gone through a little slight depression so i went to see a doctor and he prescribed citalopram during the day; and Zoplicone for night time and that medication really helped me overcome my depression back then. But this time; I think I waited too long to seek help and I feel I m in a deeper depression more than I know. I totally almost stopped talking and I have always been such a great communicator; I used to have a lot of friends; but my husband is very satisfied with being by himself and he s a little bit of a loner and his job actually doesn t permit him much for socializing; too tired to now that he s getting older. I loved people, and I still do; but i dont feel that I have anything to offer anybody at this time; I feel confused, tired, empty and lonely inside; and I feel that I m sheltering myself; and I feel a lot of anxiety because I know that I m not me right now; The doctor that prescribed me to take Venlafaxine just recently is very young; but she said she s been practicing for 7 years; and I think she s qualified to help me; but I m suppose to go for blood work actually this last week; but I plan to go for sure after Thanks giving. I tried to get a whole of my physician today; but she wasn t around. I was thinking I should talk to a Pharmasist to see if he can offer me some advice about what I should do from here. Can you give me some expert advice on how to deal with myself. Also, I d like to mention that I had a family funeral to attend today; and I didn t take the medication; and I could honestly say that I was very alert for driving, but at the memorial service; I knew people their even my own immediate family; and I didn t know how to truly connect with them. Me was their, but not the 100% me. It was my sister s husband s mother who passed away due to a long battle of cancer. She was a very courageous woman; and it was very emotional for everyone; and I had become very close to her also given the little bit of time that I ve known her. She was an angel in disguise;she was a very strongminded, courageous loving,and caring beautiful person inside and out. So it was a very energy draining, emotional day today for a lot of us.Ok I would like to know if I should continue taking the medication which is Venlafaxine and is it better to take the medication early during the day, because i was taking it late in the afternoon; because i was worried that i would be too sleepy and I would t be able to get through the day. What should I do ? I did not take the medication yesterday; should i still take it tonight now at this time which is 9:00p.m my time. I really want to get some sleep; I can t keep on this way; I need medication to help me sleep; but before I took the medication; my whole system just turned around; because since I couldn t sleep at night; after I drove my little girl to school; I found myself having to severely go back to bed; and it seemed I was able to actually relax and get some sleep; but it still was not a sound sleep; but it was enough sleep to help me cope.

I suggest you not to worry much. I can understand the stressful situation you are in. As you are aware that you have health related anxiety, I don't have to diagnose it. Once your doctors say that you do not have any physical problems, you should accept it. Because they are the authority in that front. You do not have any such medical qualification or knowledge. Secondly anxiety can produce many weird symptoms which may not have any physiological or pathological reasons. You need to overcome this health anxiety. Keeping yourself busy outside your home, exercising etc can help.  Breathing is a good technique to overcome stress.    Researches have shown that medicines alone cannot cure mental disorders. Psychotherapy to have life style changes, Yoga and meditationn to streamline thought process and  metabolism can be practiced for easy and permanent cure.

I was called big mama, laird, fatso, u name it when I was growing up all I ever wanted to do was get away and get a job and make a good living on my on and be somebody and I blew that. I ve had other jobs since the pipeline but I never felt it was good enough. Do you think im crazy or do I just feel sorry for myself. I was told once by my cousin when I was younger I never have been little that my parents only wanted one child they wanted to be like my other cousin and have one daughter and I came along and that s why my daddy drank and he and my mama fought and we had to leave home at times cause daddy hit mama or tore the house up cause he was drunk I always thought maybe if I hadn t been born my mama and daddy and sister would have been much happier. I do drink but I don t tell my doctors anymore cause the government said that was why I didn t get my disability but I never wanted a disability check cause I think I can hold a job even though I may have to change jobs more often than I used to cause I blow up, and I just walk out I don t ever want to get fired and be humiliated again I try to stay focus, calm, and do the best I can I don t know what s wrong with me and I don t think any one else does. I almost died a couple of years ago I had a blocked intenstine but I wasn t scared I felt I would go to Heaven even though I know I ve done wrong in my life I ve never hurt anyone in my life if anything I let them take advantage of me by loaning money, the rest was my fault nobody forced me to take the metaphanmien not sure how you spell it I just wanted to do a good job have energy and loose weight. i m problaly just a bad person and it would have been better if I had died when I got real sick I think my life would have been better and I could have helped the people I loved out better I had live insurance and they could have laid me to rest and paid the debits I owed off. Do you think i m crazy I don t know maybe I am but at least I try no matter what my friends have said about me in the past like I changed they didn t know who I was anymore. you see I used to listen to their problems but I never let or talked about mine and when I had no job, and no money than they said they didn t think I was ever he person they thought I was and I didn t understand why they would do that to me like I was a nobody cause I didn t ask them for anything and I tried to work on the side, and anything they ever did for me I paid them back I didn t go crying to them but yet they acted like I was trash and they were still crying and telling me their problems.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.   Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others. While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and Continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest anxiety education, progressive counseling and progressive psychotherapy. I assure you complete cure. I need to know more about your anxiety so that I will be able to diagnose it properly and provide you tips to overcome and manage your anxiety.  Hope I have answered your query.

We have a STRONG genetic predisposition for anxiety issues as well as depression. (Fortunately- this is the ONLY thing that runs in my family-- no cancer, no high blood pressure, no diabetes, serious illnesses, etc.)... Unfortunately, anxiety is NO SMALL THING. I have had the worst case of it in all of my immediate and extended family, and there are no adequate words to describe what it s like to deal this with disorder. It feels like MASSIVE amounts of adrenaline-- sometimes for long periods of time-- uncontrollably being produced by your body... and the worst part is that sometimes there are triggers that start these anxiety attacks or panic attacks-- but other times, both myself, 1/2 of my siblings --(a clue that this disorder has a genetic-base and biological root-- rather than an environmental trigger in our family or something to do with our upbringing or any dysfunction aspects of our family) -- have had absolutely TOTALLY random anxiety for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. It is a miserable condition. Now... 1 or my 2 daughters (who has always had some anxiety)... is dealing with college, assignments & homework, a few professors that are extremely difficult for students to deal with, a part time job, a boyfriend, and she is currently about to do a mid-year/ (2nd semester of her Junior college year) transfer to a different University (not large-- mid-size) beginning in January and is preparing for that. Is it any wonder that she s having panic attacks...? Of course not-- this is a very stressful age of life-- I remember it like it was yesterday; however, her family doctor and I do not seem to be able to get a handle on helping her regardless of medications tried, a counselor/ talk-therapist, lots of immediate family support and extended family support... and I guess I just need some advice about the medications that we are trying right now-- the mixture of them -- and the possible side effects that we might run into...

She has been on 20 mg of Prozac for the past approximately 8 years. We found that Prozac works extremely well with my family members... Zoloft works okay, Paxil is a disaster, (the missing doses hell and the huge amount of possible weight gain!!), and Wellbutrin-- which many of our friends all seem to swear by -- seems to help the depression aspects that my family experiences -- but it also seems to have a rare side effect in my family -- which is that Wellbutrin causes EVEN MORE ANXIETY and makes it completely unmanageable (something about the fact that it works on the other neurotransmitters which help Dopemine levels-- wheras our deficiency seems to almost ALWAYS be in the Seratonin deficiency area... I have a psychiatrist for myself-- (since I ve had anxiety attacks since the age of THREE... And yes, I do remember them well & exactly when they started...and there were no triggers). I ve tried many meds over the years to try to best treat my anxiety as well as my depression (and I ve got some OCD mixed in there too! : / )... so I know a lot about many of them. My psychiatrist and I presently, and have found that the best thing for my biology/ chemistry of my body is 1) 60 mg of Prozac 2) Temazepam for anxiety/ insomnia at bedtime 3) GABA (Neurontin) - small dose - but to keep building it up in my bloodstream to help with the anxiety, and 4th ) Valium - 3 times per day for some serious life issues that I am currently dealing with -- including the recent death of my Father 4 months ago, trying to help my Mother, being a single parent to 1 young adult (the daughter that I am writing about) as well as 1 sixteen-year old daughter, and having gone through a horrible divorce about 2 years ago after a seemingly solid and happy marriage for 28 years. (We plan to take the Valium down to 2 X per day soon... and then to 1X per day after that - in order to avoid the addictive effects). ***I want my 20 year old daughter - with all of this college-age stress, (as well as after-effects of the divorce), to see my own psychiatrist-- since he understands the biology/ chemistry of my family-- however, he has a 6-month waiting list for Intakes/ New Patients ... We can t wait that long. As I said, this daughters is seeing a good counselor/ therapist-- and she is good and helpful, but the anxiety attacks are still serious & not manageable. So her family doctor/ personal physician has tried to prescribe appropriate medications for her. 1) He has upped her dose to 40 mg. 2) He has prescribed Ativan-- ONLY for when the panic attacks/ anxiety becomes EXTREME (he gives her a limited number, of course).... and now he just met with her, and wants to had Buspar(ine) ??

I am female, moderately active, and was medically discharged from the USAF in 2009 for pain in my hips and knees and flat feet. Flat feet, which ultimately ended up being the reason the Air Force discharged me, a problem I have dealt with since I was very young. When I was a child, I remember my mother taking me to a few different doctors and them all saying the same thing. \u201cShe needs to wear her supports, and running will probably always be difficult, even impossible, for her.\u201d As a child, I didn\u2019t pay the doctor much mind, and hated my supports with a passion. I was still able to run, but pain became a common factor in my life. Joint pain. Almost all of my joints hurt on a daily basis, from my toes to my fingers. Sometimes it gets so bad, it takes me double or even triple the time it would take me to complete a task on a good day. Fatigue. Most days, I can get through just fine, keeping myself occupied and ignoring how tired I am, but when my guard is down, the fatigue sneaks up on me. Classes are hard, as well as driving long distances alone without some one to keep me awake, as I often find myself drifting off. Sometimes it\u2019s so intense that I feel like I could burst into tears, as though I have been sleep deprived for days when, in reality I sleep a perfectly substantial amount. Loose joints. I have dislocated my right elbow three times in my life before the age of five. Since then I have not re-dislocated it, though moving it in certain ways, or straining it puts a pressure and feel on it that I can only assume is it sliding in the joint. It is not pleasant, to say the least. Growing up, I remember running after my friends in the school field, but eventually having to stop after twisting one or both ankles, at times even when I was just walking. My knees have definitely been at least partially moved out of the joint, feeling like my knee-caps have been replaced by rocks. Those days, each step feels like my whole leg is a hollow tube that has a bomb right in the middle, ticking and waiting to go off. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. My jaw clicks and snaps when I talk, and most times, I can only open my mouth half way, then I have to wait a moment, and open it the rest of the way, or it makes the most awful cracking noise. In addition to having loose joints, some of my joints (like one of my thumbs, which I can dislocate by myself whenever I chose, and snap back into place easily) are double-jointed. When I first discovered I could snap my thumb into a different joint, I thought I must have had some kind of super power. It wasn\u2019t until I realized that the joint sometimes snapped without my permission that it dawned on me that it was a problem. Often times, I felt compelled to snap my thumb out of and into its joint almost all day, while at other times, I could go months without thinking of my thumb.

Arthritis of the weight-bearing joints. Mine is in my spine, L-5, and while it isnt that uncommon to have, I feel like at 20 years old, I got the short end of a stick. Bad immune system. For most of my life I have lived with the knowledge that if anyone is sick near me, I will soon catch whatever that person had, usually to a more extreme degree. Strep throat, mono, influenza, swine flu, you name it, I\u2019ve had it. Muscle formation. When I first when to bootcamp in 2009, I thought my inability to do a sit-up was due to not being physically prepared, but looking back and remembering how hard it was, how much strain it put on me, and how long it took me to be able to do just one sit up, I think that it might have been due to other reasons. As a 17 year old, doing a sit up shouldnt have been that hard. Carrying weights, my satchel, going up and down stairs, all things that involved muscles, I did badly in for a long while. It was very hard for me to gain muscle, even though I was working out every day. Skin problems. It\u2019s no secret that my skin has been one of, if not the worst things about myself, for years. Until I hit puberty, my skin was smooth, porclien, clear, and basically perfect. However, scars seems to love me. A surgery on my foot that was very minimal when I was in ninth grade left a scar that hasnt faded one bit in the almost six years that it has been, and a wound I recieved on my wrist (one that didnt even bleed) has stayed with me since fourth grade, despite immediate application of neosporin. It was nothing more than a papercut, yet it remains, and inch and a half or so long, and just as vivid as when it first appeared. Scoliosis has suddenly struck, discovered just recently when I went in for x-rays on my back due to severe pain. I\u2019m not sure if the scoliosis is what has been causing my back pain, or if it was a coincidental finding. I\u2019m pending more tests and xrays to determine the cause of the back pain that has been gradually getting worse over the last few months. Stomach problems. As long as I can remember, eating early in the morning has been a recipe for an upset stomach. Within the last few years, my stomach has started to reject foods like coffee, certain cereals, and many other foods. At first my doctor though I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but ordered testing for coeliac disease anyway. Luckily the test doesnt show any sign of Coeliac Disease (a condition in which the body sees certain foods that contain gluten, wheat, barley, etc, as an invader and rejects it, causing inflamation of the stomach lining, and other complications), but further testing and a visit to a GI are in my future. I\u2019d really like to be able to drink coffee again but I don\u2019t know when that will happen\u2026Just between you and me, I still drink it when I don\u2019t have anywhere to be, and suffer through the pain. This girl loves coffee. Neuropathy. My right foot\u2026boy would I like to feel my right foot! A few weeks into bootcamp, I noticed I was losing feeling in my foot.

To begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. To begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstaged and then surgically removed. However he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. He seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. Thus he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. At every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. Just a rising PSA and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. Doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. It will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. The blood was basically because of 2 reasons. One the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. Added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. Zytiga has a large number of side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. I assume and you should too that the call to give zytiga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. I think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. It is something that I would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. While it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. Hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure and you find strength enough to move on in life. Take care \",\n        \"Patient\": \"My husband was diagnosed 3.5 years ago with prostate cancer, stage 3, Gleason rating 9, no real elevation in PSA. He was put on hormones to shrink the tumors for surgery.  He had his prostate removed and found out he had it in 9 lymphnodes after surgery.  Went through chemo, radiation and seemed to be doing good.  A year later he found out it had metasticized to his bones and was hormone resistant with lupron.  He was put on casodex and he did well for about seven months.  He then got a hot spot in the jaw and required more radiation.  His PSA started showing a rise, so the doctor monitored him over the months to become a candidate for provenge.  He was treated with provenge in spring 2013.  About February we noticed alcohol made his legs restless and he had a cough.  Cough, lungs checked on four separate occasions, X-ray, no concerns.  In May, he started having trouble breathing.  All during this time, he went to work and would come home and lay down.  He started to throw up almost daily after eating.  In May, he was put on Zytiga, which can effect the liver.  My husband was on this for just over a month because he started to retain water in his legs and had a bloated abdomen.

Cancer metasticized to his lungs.  Heart was doing ok, he was filling with more fluid but the doctor would not drain because it would come back unless cancer w as treated.  I made the doctor put him on the table and feel his abdomen, he said he believed the cancer was in his liver.  Ascites is common with liver metastic.    More scans and confirmed in the liver.  Doctor did not tell us the extent of the damage.  Doctor suggested jevtana chemo, he went on Thursday and died on Saturday.  He went from being able to swim with our children July 4 to dying on August 18. I struggle with the lack of information that was provided, I took care of him and my two young children 9 & 12.  My husband was 46.  He was given jevtana when his platelet count was down, on Saturday he struggled with weakness, his heartrate was low, he could not eat, drink, and was constipated.  He had bloody noses, etc....  I called 911, fire dept, paramedics came and all were surprised at his condition.  I followed ambulance to the hospital, they could not get in an IV.  Ended up having to go through carotid artery.  Bloodwork was from blood taken in his groin.  My husband was throwing up blood and the doctor said it was old blood.  He went into a coma like state with me holding his hand, i could not get him to respond.  Apparently, at this time his heart stopped and they had to work him.  He never regained consciousness nor could they get his heart going.  The doctor said there was an extraordinary amount of blood.  His cancer doctor would not meet with me.  All I wanted was to know how bad he really was and get some explanation of what I saw and experienced that day.  I was refused by his office manager.  I reached out to my primary care who got this medical records for some answers.  HIPAA was on file so he could talk to me.  I found out his liver was so damaged, cancerous tumors too numerous to count.  One tumor was three inches.  Cancer throughout the bones, lymphnodes, partial hernia, right lung, enlarged spleen, he was full of it.I honestly feel that me and my family were robbed of a goodbye.  I knew he would die from cancer but was not given enough information to be given options with hospice.  My husband never knew he was in his final descent.  His last words to my son were I will be fine.  After researching myself, my husband showed all of the symptoms of full blown liver failure which may have been speeded up by the zytiga and in the end he was not in good enough shape to do jevtana.  Why was he given these treatments without all of the facts?  I am an intelligent woman and have nightmares about the lack of knowledge we had, how little I knew about what was going on because I am not medically trained.  I remember that night vividly and the suffering he went through, I saw and did things that most people may never experience.  I hope some day i can find some way to live with these memories.

The next day I would have a sore stomach \u2013 it felt swollen, I couldn\u2019t eat or I would get pain (even though I\u2019m so hungry), and I would be extremely lethargic. It happens every few weeks so going to see a GP wasn\u2019t something I could do, I would have to be in the middle of these \u2018attacks\u2019 for them to see how sick I was. Plus I was embarrassed\u2026 But in April 2013 I decided that I\u2019d bite the bullet and go and see my GP, I found it hard to describe what was happening to me without it sounding like I was getting food poisoning every few weeks. I was sent for bloods and tests: Celiacs disease was ruled out, B12 and Iron was very very low (well below low levels) and my Calprotectin was high but not alarming. I saw a Gastroenterologist where I had a Colonoscopy and Endoscopy. The GP said I had a very small ulcer in my terminal ilium \u2013 which meant very mild Crohns Disease (mild?!?!? Holey crap I would hate to know what Bad was like, I\u2019m not sure I would survive it). He wasn\u2019t sure if it was crohns though so my slides, info and findings were taken to a regular gastroenterologists gathering where they could discuss my case (there were also microbiologists and a few other smart people like that) and they came back with \u2018yes, mild crohns because of the small ulcer\u2019. (yet again\u2026 mild? I feel like I\u2019ve been cut to shreds with a rusty box knife and my guts are on the floor and being jumped on!) I was put on Pentasa \u2013 probably one of the worst things ever!, I was in pain constantly, my hair fell out in clumps, I was having silent migraines (one pupil extremely large, and the other was a pin prick) and I was on the verge of vomiting all of the time. I was told that the side effects would eventually stop. A month later I begged to stop taking this horrible drug and I started feeling better within a few days.

My doctor told me that he wanted me to have a scan of my stomach, unfortunately at the time my Father passed away suddenly and going for a scan fell off my list of priorities as I had a family to look after (as my mother passed away a few years before that), I had to sell their house, and pay for burials, lawyers etc etc (none of which caused a flare up\u2026 not stress reactive) A month went passed and I got a letter from my Gastro guy saying \u2018don\u2019t bother with the scan, if you haven\u2019t done it by now then you obviously don\u2019t need to\u2019 so that was nice....! yes my health is important to me, but I was in another part of the country attending to my grieving family \u2013 which is far more important, thank you very much. A few months later I went to a dietician to see if my flare ups were due to food \u2013 I did a FODMAPs diet to eliminate food groups, nothing caused a flare up, so that was a waste of a few hundred dollars! I did a fructose drinking test \u2013 apparently I can\u2019t have fructose and that might be my trigger. I saw a nutritionist to tailor a diet for me, and I am still being horribly sick. There is no pattern, so nothing in my diet is triggering this. The problem I have is\u2026 I don\u2019t have fructose (glucose syrup, corn syrup, invert syrup etc) in my diet, I pretty much stick to a very natural diet, veges and protein. I am very careful with everything I eat, I don\u2019t eat rubbish, I exercise, I drink lots of water (no fizzy or orange) and yet I have spent the last two days metres from my bathroom and not being able to go out. I would love nothing better than to go to the beach or a mall or hang out with friends. I can\u2019t even stand up straight without my stomach hurting!! (I just moved a tiny bit now and it feels like I\u2019ve just been roundhouse kicked in the stomach) I am in constant pain and I don\u2019t believe that \u2018mild\u2019 crohns should be this painful \u2013 In the middle of my \u2018attack\u2019 I feel like I am dying (I know that sounds like I\u2019m being dramatic, but until you\u2019ve been here then you can\u2019t judge me). The pain is so intense that I sob uncontrollably, I lie on the bathroom floor because its cold, I want to vomit (sometimes I do), and I am as white as a ghost. I just have to wait for the pain waves to stop. It\u2019s been two days so far, and will probably take that long for me to come right. I logged onto a crohns forum on my phone while on the floor one day, and mentioned how ill and in pain I was, looking for support in my darkest hours on the bathroom floor. And they were so mean to be because they said that I knew nothing of pain until I\u2019m on \u2018X\u2019 amount of drugs and had \u2018X\u2019 amount of surgeries. They even said if I was in that much pain I shouldn\u2019t be on my phone (I was sick for 72 hours!!!, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m allowed to be on my phone in that time) So I feel let down by people who should know!! Apparently those people are the gate keeps of the pain scale\u2026. Who knew? I feel let down by my Gastro person. I feel as if I\u2019ve been given the shove because I have \u2018mild\u2019 crohns. I read through the crohns disease forums and I don\u2019t get all of the symptoms that those people have \u2013 boy I feel sorry for those guys! But I haven\u2019t lost weight, I don\u2019t have any blood, I don\u2019t lose my appetite, I don\u2019t have depression, no abscesses, ulcers or fissures. The only thing I have in common is a small ulcer in my ilium, pain and Diarreha. I have a good friend who has crohns and is on Hurmia yet our symptoms are different. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t believe I actually have crohns, I think I have an ulcer because something else is going on! I will go to another gastro person, but if I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t get paid, so aside from the fact that I don\u2019t trust doctors, I want to know as much as possible before going in to see someone else who treats me like I\u2019m a \u2018mild case\u2019.", "start_char_idx": 442651, "end_char_idx": 446613, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59af4aa2-40b6-4f20-840a-3e8a6787b043": {"__data__": {"id_": "59af4aa2-40b6-4f20-840a-3e8a6787b043", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14a6f8d0-9803-4689-a6d0-ee298894cefe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "7edd0acce3f515788b5916be3372fb5eb6c4e3080e0bac3463b1ec12e23776da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b46eade-0087-4951-87f9-8cb627c424da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ea45800479dc6cf8a33ccedb2a4e2fa6321fb069f7ec126652a5e76d4172678", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "But I haven\u2019t lost weight, I don\u2019t have any blood, I don\u2019t lose my appetite, I don\u2019t have depression, no abscesses, ulcers or fissures.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  Specific side effects of Prozac related to muscle and bodybuilding.  Fatigue - Loss of normal strength so as to not be able to do the usual physical and mental activities.  Hot Flashes - Brief, abnormal enlargement of the blood vessels that causes a sudden heat sensation over the entire body. Women in menopause will sometimes experience this.  Leg Pain - A hurtful sensation in the legs that is caused by excessive stimulation of the nerve endings in the legs and results in extreme discomfort.   Malaise - The somewhat unclear feeling of discomfort you get when you start to feel sick.   Pain in limb - Sudden, sharp, and uncontrolled leg or arm discomfort.   Syncope - A short period of light-headedness or unconsciousness (black-out) also known as fainting, caused by lack of oxygen to the brain because of an interruption in blood flow to the brain.   Tightness of Chest - Mild or sharp discomfort, tightness or pressure in the chest area (anywhere between the throat and belly). The causes can be mild or seriously life-threatening because they include the heart, lungs and surrounding muscles.  Palpitation - Unusual and not normal (abnormal) heartbeat, that is sometimes irregular, but rapid, and forceful thumping or fluttering. It can be brought on by shock, excitement, exertion, or medical stimulants. A person is normally unaware of his/her heartbeat.   Hypertension - High blood pressure, a symptom of disease in the blood vessels leading away from the heart. Hypertension is known as the \u201csilent killer.\u201d The symptoms are usually not obvious; however, it can lead to damage to the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes, and can even lead to stroke and kidney failure.   Bradycardia - The heart rate is slowed from 72 beats per minute, which is normal, to below 60 beats per minute in an adult.   Tachycardia - The heart rate is sped up to above 100 beats per minute in an adult. Normal adult heart rate is 72 beats per minute.   ECG Abnormal - A test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) records the activity of the heart. It measures heartbeats as well as the position and size of the heart\u2019s four chambers.", "start_char_idx": 451484, "end_char_idx": 456114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9730965c-acd7-4c44-bd23-ad3ad986dc0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9730965c-acd7-4c44-bd23-ad3ad986dc0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f518a64b-f78a-46ee-9de5-81966508dff2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "ada40173cdf38bcdaeaaef530d9062d0fbaae494850e12d3a79377c69edfc3e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7499dcd8-1121-4630-877a-b6173aab3262", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d1756811d7ce519f239d27eca8c0da84ed56588c8aa9d3fa39e15dad4e6b719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A person is normally unaware of his/her heartbeat.

ECG Abnormal - A test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) records the activity of the heart. It measures heartbeats as well as the position and size of the heart\u2019s four chambers. It also measures if there is damage to the heart and the effects of drugs or mechanical devices like a pacemaker on the heart. When the test is abnormal this means one or more of the following are present: heart disease, defects, beating too fast or too slow, disease of the blood vessels leading from the heart or the heart valves, and/or a past or impending heart attack.   Flushing - The skin all over the body turns red.   Varicose Veins - Unusually swollen veins near the surface of the skin that sometimes appear twisted and knotted, but always enlarged. They are called hemorrhoids when they appear around the rectum. The cause is attributed to hereditary weakness in the veins aggravated by obesity, pregnancy, pressure from standing, aging, etc. Severe cases may develop swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, eczema and/or ulcers in the affected areas.  Constipation - Difficulty in having a bowel movement where the material in the bowels is hard due to a lack of exercise, fluid intake, and roughage in the diet, or due to certain drugs.

Back Discomfort - Severe physical distress in the area from the neck to the pelvis along the backbone.  Hypercholesterolemia - Too much cholesterol in the blood cells.   Hyperglycemia - An unhealthy amount of sugar in the blood.   Increased Weight - A concentration and storage of fat in the body accumulating over a period of time caused by unhealthy eating patterns, a lack of physical activity, or an inability to process food correctly, that can predispose the body to many disorders and diseases.

Muscle Cramp - When muscles contract uncontrollably without warning and do not relax. The muscles of any body organs can cramp. Prozac side effects.  Muscle Stiffness - The tightening of muscles making it difficult to bend.   Muscle Weakness - Loss of physical strength.   Myalgia - A general widespread pain and tenderness of the muscles.   Thirst - A strong, unnatural craving for moisture/water in the mouth and throat.  Muscle Contractions Involuntary \u2013 A spontaneous and uncontrollable tightening reaction of the muscles caused by electrical impulses from the nervous system.   Muscular Tone Increased - Uncontrolled and exaggerated muscle tension. Muscles are normally partially tensed and this is what gives us muscle tone.   Paresthesia - Burning, prickly, itchy, or tingling skin with no obvious or understood physical cause.   Restless Legs - A need to move the legs without any apparent reason. Sometimes there is pain, twitching, jerking, cramping, burning, or a creepy-crawly sensation associated with the movements. It worsens when a person is inactive, and can interrupt sleep so one feels the need to move to gain some relief.   Shaking - Uncontrolled quivering and trembling as if one is cold and chilled.   Sluggishness - Lack of alertness and energy, as well as being slow to respond or perform in life.

My first diagnosis was Vicarious trauma , then chronic depression. I have had a lot of stressors since my mother died a few years ago.  At that time my relationship I was in ended. (i found out he was seeing someone else at the same time I was burying my mother.)I did not  go into depression until a year later when he was forcing the sell of our own house.At this time I was is a severe car accident.  Although I was not severely injured, I had chest injuries from the inpact of the vehicles airbags, my hands would swell and I couldn't open anything, the fridge door, the front door,etc. my x-husband also cut off the utility services and he cancelled my cell phone.  He sent his friend who was the Realtor almost every day.  That is when I ended up majorly stressed and ended up needing to be hospitalized.  Our house was then sold.I ended up in  a new relationship with a man I had know for years and we move in together in May 2011.  I was feeling good so I came off my medication after a couple of months (AUG). I  only continued to take my thyroid medication. We went to Seattle for 3 days (Nov 2011) and then unexpectedly we needed to go to Arizona. That was suppose to be a short trip but we ended up there for 2 months mid Jan 2012). I felt good the whole time I was gone and for another couple of months, until mid March  2012) a total of about 7 mos. I had a lot of stress as soon as I got back .  I had a lot of dental work done in a week. Also the estate I thought was finished turned out to be a problem because my sister was refusing to sign the release. So then that came down to her lawyer & my lawyer until it was settled.  After that was dragged out, It had brought up all the upsetting information surrounding my twin's death, and my parents. And the lack of her involvement during that time.  I went into depression and ended up being hospitalized.We moved to a different city,and am seeing a new Phsychiatrist.  I am still depressed. having problems I have been asked if I am Bipolar?  I don't know.  I have never had  mania or psychosis. This time I have been in severe depression now for 10 mos. During this time I was dealing with my mothers estate, selling her house, and dealing with a lot of stress and pressure from my estranged sister. Then one day and for no reason, when i woke up I was completely out of my depression.(however for those previous 10 mos. I had overwhelming thoughts of giving up and the night before I felt suicidal, feelings complete hopeless etc.  and the inability to feel joy.  That good feeling lasted for the entire  month of March.2013 and then I slipped back into depression. The beginning of April 2013, my psychiatrist  sent me to Creest (a short stay medical centre for people with mental illness in place of a hospital.  AS soon as I walked in the doors, I immediately snapped out of depression. I stayed their for 2 weeks (without havinga a medication change which was going to be to Welbrutrin).  After leaving their I continued feeling good for the rest of the month of April, this too lasted only 1 month. The beginning of in May I could actually feel my good mood slipping away (like a wave going through my head LIKE A MIGRAINE WITH NO PAIN).

Physiotherapy and sex therapy (this is only for those who are in a relationship). 3. Any androgen deficiency due to age is to be corrected. For this testosterone levels are to be measured and medicines like L-carnitine or DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) are given. 4. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like Sildenafil, Vardenafil or Tadalafil might show positive results when given in the recommended dose. 5. If there is hyperprolactinemia then medicines are there to reduce prolactin level. 6. If above does not work then intracavernosal injections might help under medical supervision. 7. The transurethral administration of Alprostadil (Prostoglandin E1) gel also helps many patients. 8. There are special vacuum devices which can be used with intracavernosal injections or PDE 5-inhibitors. 9. Ligation of penile veins and arterial revascularization are the surgical methods used. It is important to know that please try the above methods of treatment under medical supervision one at a time and know which is the most suitable treatment. The sexual performance of a male decreases after 40 years and is more on decline after 60 years. At 47 years, you should get a semen analysis done to know the quality of sperms produced and if it is favorable for pregnancy. The choice of adoption of children is always there if you are not able to have children in the natural method. I hope this helps.  \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hello doctor, I am a 47-years-male. I am still unmarried and virgin. I am struggling with a humiliating problem and unable to contact any andrologist directly. Hence, I am humbly requesting your kind help with your valuable advice. When I was 27, I was unable to get sexual erection though impulse was there. I contacted a local urologist, he gave me Papaverine injection to my penis and advised to use Libidol tablets at that time. I did not find any improvement. Later, I approached a famous sexologist in our city. He said nothing is wrong in me and wrote Mustang, Alprazolam and Fluoxetine tablets. Accordingly, I used, but no result I observed. My sister is a gynecologist and I gone through her old medical books for sexual impotence and gathered some information on various tests. Later, when I was 29 years, again I met the same urologist and expressed my willingness to go for a Doppler ultrasound test and attended, which revealed that there was arterial insufficiency. Basing on the report, the urologist suggested me to go to a particular place to approach famous andrologist there. I went and met the andrologist. He conducted the Rigiscan test for two days and gave Prostaglandin E1 to my penis and injected some distilled water into my penis through the machine for maximum enlargement of the penis and suggested me to use simply Nuzak capsules (Fluoxetine content) without saying any further.

As I said, still I am a virgin and whenever I failed to control myself, I used to do masturbation. But within 30 minutes, I used to get excellent erections further. This was happened until I attained 43 years. Later, there is a gradual change and now not getting day time erections and during night sleep. I observed though there is an erection, I am getting around 50% hardness only and not getting good erection and maximum enlargement of penis as earlier. I do not have any sugar or BP issues. I never took alcohol and I am purely vegetarian. Now I am getting pressure for marriage. I am unable to take a decision whether to go for or not keeping in view the sexual erection problem. I do not know whether I can make happy of my lady and give birth to a child. I saw that Aswagandha capsules boost sexual erections and hence using for the past one month. Also read in websites that horny goat weed (750 mg) with maca (150 mg) also gives good results in correction of erectile dysfunction and hence, recently bought one and using for the past one week one tablet per day. Some websites also suggesting to use Pycnogenol with L arginine for good erections. However, I would like to have a specialist consultation. Hence, could you please help me by guiding the way I have to follow to get rid out of this embarrassing problem? Also, suggest to me whether horny goat weed with maca is good or bad. If any medication is suggested, I can follow it. Earlier, I gone for self hormonal tests and found all FSH, LH, serum prolactin and testosterone were within the normal range.

Also not sure if this next group of symptoms is related to previous but i believe it to be in some way:: started to get large dark purplish/gray/black colored lump coming out of my rectum- hemmoroid possibly cuz its somewhat painful, occasionally itchy, and uncomfortable (appeared several days ago), been switching between constipation and diarrhea, theres burning sensation in rectum when having BM, and noticed today when wiping after a BM, the toilet paper and the feces had some dark spots thru out that were similar to what appeared on the tampons. It seems to me like some type of bacteria/fugus/infection (some kind of organism...) is inside my colon/digestive tract and in my reproductive system some where as well and its eating away at my body....and btw I have no pain or problems urinating. SO ayway i went to the ER several nights ago bc i had several of the above named symptoms but more importantly at the time i was having excrucuating pains in my lower, right abdominal area (btw ive already had appendicitis and had my appendix removed about 8-9yrs ago so nothing to do with my appendix) but its a small town so no OB/GYN was on duty, so did not have an exam done to look inside my uterus.. they just took urine sample and did blood work. The results they said were that i was not pregnant and according to my blood work i had no infections, in fact the PA said my blood work came back perfect . so they suggest going to see a gyno to get checked out. but when i called around town and surrounding towns the next day, every OB/GYN i called was completely booked for weeks! so... if i have some kind of infection, wouldnt that have shown up in my blood work??? also think ill mention that i started doing meth, IV/injecting it, several weeks ago (approx 6-8 weeks ago). ive lost a lot of weight and my already small breasts have shrunk down to barely anything now. could all this be the cause of a hormonal imbalance due to using meth?? could a hormonal imbalance cause fibroids, cysts, or anything of the sort? and bc been doing meth i hardly ever sleep and barely eat anything either. so i was shooting up the other day and couldnt keep the needle inside my vein bc i was so shaky (from doing all the meth id done and lack of food or sleep over several days in a row) but some blood that had entered the syringe began to coagulate and block up the tip of the needle so i took it out, put it all back on spoon (including the coagulated blood) added some burning hot water to it, attempted to break apart and dissolve the coagulated blood, mixed it all up again and proceeded to shoot the crap into my vein anyway. which it took literally a couple of hours for this entire process and by time i actually found good vein and injected it so due to the coagulated blood and the fact that it was all sitting in the open air on the spoon and/or in a syringe for over 2 hrs before i put it in my blood stream, wondering if this could have caused some bacteria or infection to enter my body...? but once again wouldnt this have shown up when my blood work was done?? and even if did cause infection or whatever then why would it go straight to my vaginal/uterus area and my colon area?", "start_char_idx": 487527, "end_char_idx": 491892, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b46c717c-64e2-4082-83df-d1aa06c630a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b46c717c-64e2-4082-83df-d1aa06c630a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0cc187f2-2ce5-413f-b74c-a56643505233", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "9a36fc4ee1f427353f2631c76f760ed942e7667ec74233aebfce9720effbce65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9827e201-2fb1-428e-a922-f8d015a5d09b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1893f69b481b2ba0fcefca5c0ec56d860840855b8f78a2a2aaa88d20f624b34f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "which it took literally a couple of hours for this entire process and by time i actually found good vein and injected it so due to the coagulated blood and the fact that it was all sitting in the open air on the spoon and/or in a syringe for over 2 hrs before i put it in my blood stream, wondering if this could have caused some bacteria or infection to enter my body...? but once again wouldnt this have shown up when my blood work was done?? and even if did cause infection or whatever then why would it go straight to my vaginal/uterus area and my colon area? plus with the pains/inflammation in my vaginal area, that began weeks ago before this coagulated blood incident, and has just recently gotten much worse, with the blood clots and such... one more thing along line of drug use is that prior to the recent meth use, i was clean and sober for about 2 months but before that id been addicted to and was an IV heroin user for about 6yrs...

He never had problems with erection even on his post cycle therapy, but after that injury he suddenly lost his ability to reach orgasm. That bruise was still there, and we went to a 6 OR 7 DIFFERENT UROLOGISTS, AND NOT A ONE TOLD US TO QUIT SEX. We always got a reply THE MORE THE MERRIER.

So, after a year and a few months, he realized that his glans skin started to thicken and loosen its color. It started being somewhat pale-ish and dry, also with some of the wreckles that started to emerge. I got a new job and my boss s wife is a dermatologist, so i realized we need to see a new doctor (since even dermatologists weren t able to tell us WHAT S THE PROBLEM- and since here in Serbia not a single doctor believes in keratinization) we gave that doctor a visit. She looked at his penis and right away she said- that s eczema . My fiancee used to wash his penis with baby soaps that are a bit more alkaline and can cause dryness, but we never had a direct thought that could lead us that that s wrong. He used a lot of creams to moisture his glans, urea&those kind of creams, but nothing could change. He did blood work and his estradiol and prolactin levels were THREE (yes) times higher than normal level should be. So we also took cabergoline (dostinex) to try with that. Those days he also had erection problems...a lot of them. So the dermatologist told us to STOP USING SOAP, try using only non perfumed creams (here in our country we have a cream that s called Pantenol and it s for all skin problems), and to take some apothecary cream that she s going to prescribe. Suddenly, literally a weak after he stopped using soap and started using right creams (Pantenol, we still didn t get a pharmacy one) his penis started tingling like when he was uncircumcised. He called that as a constant arousal feeling . His glans has became all sensitive like before, he could feel everything from the ligther touch to harder ones. We were enormously happy... I cant even tell you what kind of problems we were having with our relationship since he agreed that his life can end now if he can t enjoy in me, or I can with him, since I couldn t relax always wondering does he feel something when i do something or not. It was hell. Fights, crying, depression. I can t even describe. So we were in heaven again! Sex 3-4 times a day, two or three times a week. Living a dream. We also took HGH (human growth hormone) since we read that it helps skin and nerves rejuvenation. It is expensive as hell but we took a shot. But then, he got on his another steroid cycle. His sensitivity had also slighter decreased before cycle, but we thought it s probably cause we did it too much. And on cycle it started increasing again. But then it stopped. And then started decreasing again. I need to say that he started his cycle with still increased levels of estrogen. His glans dried even more. It was red only in the middle, right on the tip and on his upper side, opposite of frenulum. But there was no bruising, no capillaries broken, nor anything. I guess we just went too much again and it caused that. His erections are fine, he gets aroused only by kissing me and having a foreplay, but now he tells me he doesn t feel a SINGLE SPOT on his glans that s sensitive. Not even when he squeezes glans a bit. His orgasms are again, how he s saying dry, without build up, the build up lasts for a second or two and then disappears.

Two weeks ago, I had flu symptoms, like headaches, body aches, low fever, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The chest symptoms were there straight away, and my asthma medicines (Symbicort and Ventolin) were not working from the start. I was taking 200 mg Symbicort twice daily, and Ventolin every three hours or so. After a weekend of being short of breath and tight-chested, I was on my way to my GP just to run my symptoms by him to see if I needed a GP or ER. He told me to take 12 puffs of Ventolin and go straight to the ER. The ER did ECG, chest x-ray, and blood tests. They gave me a nebulizer and Prednisone 50 mg and sent me on my way. I was still short of breath. My chest x-ray was clear, and my blood showed no infection. I did not have any improvement for the week, and I was taking Prednisone, Symbicort, and Ventolin every 2 to 3 hours. I was short of breath all week. I went to another GP, who sent me straight to the ER again. An intern took my history, after three hours of waiting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, mild intermittent sharp chest pain, and lifelong asthma, etc. I also explained that I am a non-wheezing asthmatic, and when I feel at my worst nothing can ever be heard on my chest. Interestingly, he only noted intermittent sharp chest pain not worse on deep inspiration. He did not note chest tightness when breathing. I also told them that for the 10 days, I had coughed more at night but the shortness of breath decreased overnight every night and was gone in the morning and then just gradually increased over the day until it was sober. Then the registrar came and told me that I was to be sent home, as I was taking too much medication and that was causing my heart to race, and that is why I had shortness of breath. I explained that I had shortness of breath before taking lots of medicines and that was why my physician sent me to the hospital the previous day.", "start_char_idx": 498034, "end_char_idx": 502037, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0325a5a5-b9cf-429b-90d6-5c8f1d3fa5b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0325a5a5-b9cf-429b-90d6-5c8f1d3fa5b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8486d82a-dcdc-4263-a348-e7ed0aa3fd57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "b74524f3ea6cf20e299d8113440f1f44f610caa0d58afb77b6a5598ff8a0d49a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ec53bb6-4a00-4fe0-9f78-ecef12e45ac1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f96d5c24d5f1f767cec35d4832cccb30decd03709bcd1d4a65fd0a7323f7f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I also explained that I am a non-wheezing asthmatic, and when I feel at my worst nothing can ever be heard on my chest.

I explained that I had shortness of breath before taking lots of medicines and that was why my physician sent me to the hospital the previous day. I did not even know that I could take it more than my usual two puffs every four hours. I was taking medicines as per my brand new asthma plan, which was given to me by my GP. I asked him \\\"was my heart rate high when the intern tested me?\\\" To this, he answered, \\\"I do not know, and I have not looked.\\\" Then he took my pulse for about three seconds with no watch and said it was 100 per minutes, but my heart rate has been tested over and over all week and was normal every time, that is why I challenged him. He then said that he would keep me in overnight for observations and to await a blood test for a blood clot. The intern had told me they would be doing an ECG and lung function tests. They put me in a room with about eight recliner chairs and no blanket. The nurse attended to everyone else in that room all night and did not even look at me once. She just ignored me. She did not even come close to me. I was awake most of the night. I could hear everything she did with the other patients. My breathing settled a little, but it was still labored all night, and I was coughing all night. They would not let me have my asthma medication. I felt hot and then cold, and I had a migraine. I felt so unwell that I could not get up to reach the button and was just waiting for her to come and help me so that I could tell her. At handover in the morning, she told the next nurse all my information loudly until she came to the bit where she whispered to him that I had been fine all night. I could not believe it. I managed to get some Panadol out of the new nurse, as he did my observation at 7 AM. Then the morning doctor, a young boy, told me he was sending me home, as I was better. I said that my shortness of breath was slowly returning with movement, as I told the doctors at night would happen. He said with asthma; I would be better off being at home as if I caught one of the nasty bugs in there things would get way worse. He said \\\"you do not look like you are dying, and that is my job to see if you look like you are dying. And if you do not, then you are sent home\\\". They never gave me an ECG, and they never gave me lung function tests. My discharge report simply stated that I should go home and take my Ventolin if severely short of breath with wheezing. They made up their minds that I was just taking too many medicines or that I had a 10-day long panic attack.\u00a0My GP asked me if I had been put on any antibiotics, and I told her how the ER said I had no infection. The GP said, but how did they know if they only took blood? She told me that the hospital tests would not show up a chest infection. So she put me on five days of Augmentin, and the headache is gone now and asthma slightly better, but I still feel tightness and short of breath. I have been sitting for an hour and a half and am breathing like I have been on a long walk. This has really scared me. The only message I got from the ER says that do not go there even if you have serious symptoms. I have been sent there by doctors.

First the right ear was infected, and now the left. Please help.\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello. Ear infections in children are very common. Children have a straight and wide eustachian tube that helps throat microbes to reach the ear easily and cause infection. So whenever she has a chest infection or throat pain or cold or flu, there are chances that her ears will also get infected. Once the ears get infected, then subsequently more chances that throat and nose infections will go up to the ear. Once ear gets infected, it is very painful and pus is produced inside. The pus breaks open the eardrum and come outside. Thereafter with medicines and the body's immunity, the ear condition resolves. But the hole in the eardrum does not close very soon. It takes a few weeks. During this time, water should not go into the ear while bathing or swimming, etc. You should take care that your daughter does not insert any cotton or match stick or anything inside the ear. Talking about the medicines given by ENT doctor and the pediatrician, both are almost the same. They both have given a different set of antibiotics and the pediatrician has added Salbutamol, which is mostly because your daughter might have been having chest problem or wheezing while going to him. Talking about staphylococcus, it is a dangerous organism when it becomes resistant to common antibiotics. Many times, it is a commensal in our body, commensal meaning routine organism. In the C/S report that you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the organism is sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. I suggest you instill two drops of Ciplox (Ciprofloxacin) in either ear thrice daily for a week and continue the medicines that the doctor has asked you to.

Tell your daughter to be bold and friendly and bribe her with chocolates so that the doctor is able to look into the ear and tell you clearly what it is. If possible ask the doctor to show the findings using an oto-endoscope which can be connected to the TV screen and shown to all including your daughter. Till then the precautions you take are: 1. No water inside the ear. 2. Can apply the drops I suggested. 3. Do not continue nasal drops (ENT drops or pediatrician drops) for more than four days in continuity (it can cause other nasal problems) 4. If she develops throat or nose problem, immediately show her to ENT and take adequate treatment. 5. Avoid cold foods and juices, give homemade juices and home cooked food. 6. Avoid excessive sun, dust, and dehydration. Talking about the reasons for frequent nose and throat infections, she could be having tonsillar enlargement and frequent inflammations. With your next query, please take a picture of your daughter's open mouth showing details of tonsils and back of the throat so that we can assess if there is a tonsillar problem which may need some other treatment.

The history is complicated trying to explain the symptoms but I will do my best. It was detected polyhydramnios in pregnancy. My daughter\u00a0born at 36 weeks 4 days through emergency C-section due to pre-eclampsia. Her weight was 3070g. NG tube passed three times due to polyhydramnios. We went home on day two. Readmitted on day five for phototherapy. Till 4 months of age, several visits with health visitor and GP for colic like symptoms and constipation. She will scream in pain which opening her bowel and only opening her bowels every four to five days. Over this time they tried Colief, Infacol, Lactulose, Glycerin suppositories, Ranitidine, Gaviscon and Domperidone, nine different formulas and we also tried all common natural remedies for reflux like keeping upright after feeding, etc. No alleviation of symptoms at all with exception of glycerin suppositories which did seem to help the constipation. In\u00a08 months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of Lactulose and Movicol for 16 weeks. He suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels. And so Glycerin was stopped. We\u00a0delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment.

In\u00a08 months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of Lactulose and Movicol for 16 weeks. He suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels. And so Glycerin was stopped. We\u00a0delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment. At this point, her symptoms completely changed to intermittent diarrhea and constipation, bowel frequency increased to once a day, colic like pain and she does not start vomiting until the consistency of the food moves up to a more solid consistency. The laxatives made absolutely no difference. In her 10 months of age the constipation has turned to diarrhea. The doctor is happy that it was functional constipation and discharged her. At\u00a011 months, she had first acute episode of chronic diarrhea and forceful vomiting lasted for 16 days which coincides with the introduction of cow's milk. During\u00a011-14 months of age she was introduced to solid food. Chronic forceful vomiting which does not seem to follow any pattern. A food diary is followed for several weeks and there does not seem to be any consistent non-IgE allergy as a cause. During her\u00a014 months of age we had an appointment with dietician and switched from normal formula to Pepti and then Neocate. Her chronic wheeze disappears overnight but chronic vomiting continues. She troubleshoots overfeeding as a cause. We are feeding her more as she is vomiting. When we did not substitute the feeds she lost weight. So, if she vomited a feed we gave her another one hour later, we fed her small quantities throughout the day to try and prevent vomiting. Again in\u00a015 months consulted her dietician and he suggested definite non-IgE\u00a0cow's milk protein allergy and to try trial and error with other three common allergies- soy, wheat and dairy. So, then for a month we followed strict elimination of those three. This month she had only Neocate liquid diet plus corn snacks (organix) and one paella meal. Symptoms improved but sporadic forceful vomiting remains. She\u00a0tolerated only one baby paella meal well which is overcooked rice, very mushy consistency. Now again we attempted to challenge the three foods\u00a0back in and move beyond this one meal. All attempts were failed. Her reaction to us seems to be much more about the consistency of the food rather than what the food is. She can tolerate a large amount of breadcrumbs, but cannot tolerate a piece of toast. We continue with food diary and there really is no clear pattern which isolates one food. Again in her 17 months age when we consulted her dietician he was unsure whether the\u00a0symptoms fit FPIES at all and suggests gastro referral. Then she had second acute episode. We went A and E on day five and was sent home with suggestion of gastroenteritis. Chronic vomiting and diarrhea lasted 15 days. She lost 10% of her body weight. Sent home on Neocate as the only diet.\u00a0But, there is no evidence of gagging, choking or problem swallowing. No fussing or wriggling during feeding. Four months back, her weight was 12.3 kg and now 10.9 kg. Her barium x-ray showed mild malrotation but at MDT it was decided this was not explanation of symptoms. We have recently tried Omeprazole to rule out severe reflux and it made no change. Genetic blood tests, kidney and abdominal ultrasound were normal. For us her symptoms now are identical to what they were like before the onset of weaning. Again, she is suffering from intermittent colic pain and constipation, but there is no vomiting. She is not sleeping well at all. We have increased her water intake and added Lactulose and the stools are no longer hard, but she still seems uncomfortable. Stools are very dark green.\u00a0We have tried a couple of solids. She prefers crunchy food. She tolerates corn-based crisps as they basically dissolve into crumbs into your mouth. We tried peas, grapes and she passed all of the peas, grapes and beans completely undigested in her feces. Without solids she does not sleep well at all, because the Neocate just does not fill her up for long enough and so she is screaming all night because she is hungry.

There is no question that you have multiple gallstones. There is no obstruction of the bile duct , the channel that carries the bile from the gallbladder to the intestine, which is good. Your liver enzyme levels are normal which means you don't have signs of inflammation of the liver or the surrounding organs, like pancreas etc. You are very mildly anemic, but not to worry. You mention one attack of abdominal pain. As for fatty liver, it is very mild and with normal enzymes, again, I would not worry. Besides, during a laparoscopic procedure, they will take a good look at your liver and if abnormal or suspicious, they can take a biopsy. Laparoscopic approach has made gallbladder surgery very much easier. First, it is same day surgery. Recovery is faster. It used to be 7-10 days in the hospital years ago with tubes in the stomch and bladder etc. Problem with large abdominal incision, infection, wound separation etc. etc . All that is not true now. Very rarely, for technical reasons or location of the gallbladder, they may decide to convert to the old way with open surgery. In experienced hands , this is very unlikely to happen. I would recommend that you start taking some oral iron supplements along with a Super B-Coplex Vitamin daily. Along with this you can take Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and 1000 mg. of Vit-C daily. If you are a little over weight lose a few. I wish you well. Elective surgery is much better than emergency surgery for complications. \",\n        \"Patient\": \"hello I m 44 yrs old. last 24th November, 2012 I felt huge pain in my upper abdomen and after ultrasound doctor found gallbladder stone and suggestive fatty liver .

I have cystic fibrosis and pulmonary shunt. How to titre my oxygen levels?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello. Well, that was a wonderful and well-detailed query. I will answer your query in parts. Regarding your insensitivity to low O2 saturation: Well, this is an expected development in long-standing lung problems. Continuous exposure to low oxygen levels over long time will decrease the brain's sensitivity for low oxygen and hence that is the reason you breathe shallow in spite of desaturation. So the body's next line of defense for low oxygen is CO2. When the brain's sensitivity to oxygen is reduced then the brain uses CO2 level to trigger breathing. But because of your advanced cystic fibrosis exchange of Co2 and O2 is not happening adequately at the lung level and hence your body is retaining Co2 because it is not able to remove it out. My advice at this point is to do breathing exercises, take long inhalation and long exhalation. Also, do incentive spirometry exercise. Coming to your hypothesis of right to left shunt you are absolutely right. But shunting could be at the lung level or at the heart level. In your case, the chances of shunt being at lung are more likely but still, tests should be done so that there is no shunting at the heart.

Also, do incentive spirometry exercise. Coming to your hypothesis of right to left shunt you are absolutely right. But shunting could be at the lung level or at the heart level. In your case, the chances of shunt being at lung are more likely but still, tests should be done so that there is no shunting at the heart. For that, I advise you get echo with contrast with positional change maneuver. If your venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood then the total Co2 content of the blood increase (as venous blood contains more CO2 than arterial) and thus the Co2 gradient (the difference between arterial Co2 and alveolar or in simple terms lung Co2) decrease and Co2 elimination is directly dependent on Co2 gradient. Higher the gradient more the elimination and less retention and vice versa. Anemia contributing to O2 desaturation and Co2 retention: If you are anemic then your blood carries less O2 so at rest your O2 demands would be less but on exercise your O2 demands increase a lot which cannot be met due to low O2 carrying capacity of your blood, thus leading to profound O2 desaturation. But what is not know is why are you suffering from anemia? What is the cause? Because if we can correct your anemia your O2 requirement even on exercise can come down. I advise if any evaluation from your anemia point of view has been done kindly upload so that I can help further. Until your cardiac evaluation for intra cardiac shunt and anemia evaluation are completed, I advise you to keep titrating your O2 to maintain spo2 > =95% both at rest and on mild exercise. Till correction of any shunt (if possible) and correction of anemia is done you will desaturate on exercise and hence increase O2 during exercise.  \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hello doctor, I feel that I am a complicated case and I am trying to figure out the best way to titrate my oxygen treatment. I have late-stage cystic fibrosis, and I am experiencing a few months of exacerbation that has led to me needing oxygen full time. A few weeks ago I began, for the first time, to titrate my O2 saturation vigilantly to between 90-95%, to combat Co2 retention. Previously, even when sick and using O2 full time, I had not retained Co2. But on my recent ER visit when I was in pulmonary distress (very short of breath) my pCo2 was 65. I was advised to titrate it. I had been advised before, but I had not always done so rigorously, because frankly it just felt uncomfortable. This time I stuck to it, however, because I was very nervous about increased Co2 retention. My pCo2 has wavered around, from 65-62-57-62-58, in about three weeks. The thing that has significantly changed, however, is that I am no longer sensitive to low oxygen saturation. My breathing is much more shallow, and I can sit comfortably at 90% and not even feel bad. It is scary because I can also be walking around and desaturating to 85% without even feeling it. I used to be able to know my oxygen saturation just by feel and how short of breath I was. My breathing, as I said, is very shallow even as I desaturate. It is only when I exercise to a certain point, at high levels of O2, that I am able to inhale and exhale involuntarily and deeply. I have some different issues that make me wonder if the protocol for titrating oxygen at low saturations for Co2 retention is the right treatment for me, and I am going in circles trying to figure it out. My doctors do not seem too concerned about my Co2 retention in general, given my late-stage CF and that I am about to be listed for a transplant, but I always want to figure out what is the best thing to be doing. I have a right to left pulmonary shunt. It is demonstrated when I lie down. My O2 saturation actually rises while lying down, and rises higher if I lie on my left side vs right. So I believe that this would be a component in that venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood but I do not have a grasp of how that could effect Co2 retention (only that it can lower my O2 saturation).

Lastly, my lungs have improved and infection has cleared somewhat, but I have not been able to come closer at all to being off oxygen. I know I do need to accept that maybe this is not a reality. But regardless, my O2 needs are lower, yet as soon as I exercise or move around even a little, they drop rapidly. Before three weeks, it was much less extreme.

I also had difficulty completely emptying my bowel. Around mid-December, after running a 5K, I had pain in on the right side in my pelvic area which lasted for a week. I also had pain and pressure under my right rib cage. The pain in the pelvic area increased and I had abdominal swelling (a pelvic MRI showed nothing). When the swelling and pain did not subside, I ended up going to the ER in January of 2104 . All they found after a CAT scan was excess abdominal fluid; they said this was possibly from an ovarian cyst that had ruptured. My GI woes continued and I felt like I was emptying too much from my bowels whenever I went in the morning. The stools would often stick to the toilet bowl. I also continued to have incomplete evacuation. This continued on and off for months. In April and May, I had two days where my stomach felt so bloated and full that I had to throw up to relieve the pressure. In May, I ran the Broad Street run and had stomach pain the entire race. All throughout the summer, I still had problems with emptying my bowels and emptying what looked like too much. In August, I took my migraine meds (Immitrex, which always gave me abdominal pain, but I continued to take it as it took away my migraines) one night and went for a 16 mile run the next day. When I finished, I had bad pain under my right ribcage and the pain descended down to my stomach. I ate chili that night and this worsened my pain to the point where I considered going to the ER. This triggered two months of my stomach feeling unsettled and my stools looked like sludge (again, I was emptying too much and still could not completely empty my bowel). After this \u201cGI attack\u201d I lost 7 pounds. I finally went to a GI doctor in October who discovered after doing an endoscopy that I had severe esophogitis (even though I never had any symptoms of GERD\u2014no acid reflux, esophageal burning, etc). There was also a small, benign nodule that had formed under my right rib cage (where I had the pain). After this diagnosis, I changed my diet (I eliminated acidic foods) and my stomach settled down, even though I still had stomach discomfort off and on.

After this diagnosis, I changed my diet (I eliminated acidic foods) and my stomach settled down, even though I still had stomach discomfort off and on. I also continued to have pressure under my right rib cage. In December of 2014, I had a hysterectomy (I had multiple issues with my uterus). I recovered well and I felt like my GI tract was \u201cback on track.\u201d I was on a good routine where my system emptied at the same time every day and it was emptying what seemed to be a normal amount and it looked like \u201chealthy\u201d stool. I had also put on the weight I had lost from the previous GI attack. In February of 2015, after reading about the dangers of esophogitis, I decided to take the PPI my doctor prescribed in October of 2014. I then started having acid reflux\u2014burning in my esophagus, burps that were stuck in my throat, etc. So, I returned to my GI doc who then told me to take 60 mg of Dexilant. I did so for a week and 4 days and then I developed severe abdominal pain. I immediately went off of the Dexilant and what ensued was two months of GI hell\u2014I had cramping pain in stomach that was relieved somewhat with taking different laxatives to empty my system. I also was not able to eat most evenings because of the pain in my stomach. As a result, I lost 9 pounds. One doctor said that stopping the acid production in my stomach caused bad bacteria to grow/caused a leaky gut and this seems like a likely theory as different foods that I ate seemed to worsen the pain. Mid April I also ate salmon and asparagus one day and this resulted in awful pain in my stomach in the middle of the night and into the next day. I had to throw up to try and relieve the pain\u2014what came out was full pieces of the asparagus that I had eaten. I had an abdominal MRI to rule out anything going on in my stomach. It came back negative. Now in May, the abdominal pain has stopped, but I have abdominal discomfort most evenings\u2014my stomach feels full and bloated and my gas feels trapped. The pressure is not relieved until I go to the bathroom the next day. I am back to not being able to completely empty my bowels\u2014there seems to always be a little more that I need to strain to get out (what comes out is normally flat and/or thin or a small \u201cnugget\u201d when the \u201cextra\u201d does come out). To rule out anything serious going on with my colon, I had a colonoscopy on May 4; I also had a repeat endoscopy. My colon looked great, but I still have a little scarring on my esophagus. I don\u2019t know if the PPI incident reveals that I may have low stomach acid and not high stomach acidity. Or, did it exacerbate an existing condition with SIBO. Do I have motility issues where food is either moving too quickly or not quickly enough through my system? If so, what creates this problem? Is it possible my gallbladder is not working correctly and breaking down my food even though the abdominal MRI did not show anything? If you are able to lend any insight as to what my going on with my GI track, I would greatly appreciate it!\",\n        \"email\": \"ypyhkq@outlook.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"7874046745\"\n

operation on my feet,i had a bilateral foot operation to straighten my big toes as i had bunions on both feet,i also had 6 of my little toes straightened,the doctor said they would operate on both feet at the same time as my brother was off work and could look after me as i recovered,after the operation i was in a lot of pain and making involuntary movements jolting forwards and backwards,i got 2 hours sleep and i was in agony,the nurses eventually gave me morphine to calm me down,i was getting no abdominal pain at this time as it was my feet that was hurting like they had been broke in two,the next night was similar after that my feet although were sore,started to calm down,i didn t know if i had damaged anything and as i was getting no pain from my abdomen i thought i must be OK,but i was on a lot of tablets at the time,i always worry about side effects but thought the medication would do me more good than bad,about 2days after finishing my medication i started to get a pain in my right side half way between my naval and side,like a glowing ball,it was uncomfortable to sit,and very painful,it felt like someone was pressing a knife into my side,the pain seemed to calm down if i lay flat after a while,i went to see the doctor,she said it could be a stone and sent me for ultrasound,endoscopy,colonoscopy this was over a few months and all came back clear,i was also sent for blood tests which came back clear,although my liver profile was slightly high,by this time i was getting a pain in my left side as well halfway between my naval and side although this was not constant,i went to see a herbalist who nearly got the pain to go,but the pain came back twice as bad,after one year i went back again to the herbalist who gave me the same medicine again,i tried it for longer but my symptoms did not improve,i was going back to the doctors who was telling me it was nothing to worry about,sometimes these things sort themselves out and they couldn t see my having this the same time next year,all this time it was getting worse,i was put on lanzoprazol which just gave my direah,omoprazol which did the same,there were no improvements to the pain,my symptoms were getting worse,ihave seen 3 or 4 consultants,the comments i have had are,sometimes these things cant be found,it might get better over time,try to do things as normal and see how you are,what will you do if we cant find out what it is?all the time my symtoms have been getting worse,i was also put on anti-depressants which just put me to sleep and i woke up with the same pain,more recentally ive been put on gabapenin and pain killers which are not getting me any better as my symptoms have got worse still,i told the consultant the tablets were not working and he said you must not be on a high enough dosage,ill increase them and see you in 6 months,i felt the worst i have ever felt,he was telling me sometimes these thing cannot be found we just have to learn to cope with them,if it was him

Told by the pain Dr. to stay on the Lortab and come to the pain clinic every 4 or 5 weeks for epidurals. Epidurals were not only painful but I got very little relief if any from them. Finally PCP started me on oxycontin and Fentynal patch. I was much better for awile. I was taught that in so called pain management you would gradually increase dose until you knew the patient was experiencing some quality of life. I reached rock bottom after telling PCP my quality of life was slipping away. Finally I asked for an increase in pain med as pain was now 24 hours a day. I could not function. I was told no, and referred to pain clinic for more epidurals and Narcotics. The day I went in to office for routine followup and new perscriptions I was ask for a urine specimen. After all I d been thru over the last 8 to 10 years, all the operations and all the pain. The loss of any quality of life. I am in my 70 s and lost all those Golden years, 10 of them. Asking for a urine specimen. I felt made ME the criminal. I decided right then I asked to be titrated off the narcotic meds. I will die with all the pain before I will let anyone treat me like a criminal. So you go on breaking your solom oath by hurting patients . Doctors swore to do no harm. A large % of those being hurt and are suffuring are the geriatric population. I feel Obama has been behind a lot of this but you know I believe a lot of the fault falls on every Doctor, Nurse, and everyone working in health care. STAND UP FOR YOUR PATIENTS. yOU ALL ARE JUST LIKE THE POLITICIANS. tO SAVE THEIR OWN HIDES THEY JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES TO WHAT IS HAPPINING TO MEDICINE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SAY NOTHING. tHE PUBLIC CAN T EVEN GET TOGETHER AND STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. The old time Doctor s predicted It would be like this. They said if the HMO went through it would be the death of our wonderful medical care in this country. Many have passed but they were right on. They realized that there would not be anymore decent medical care. The patient is really obsolete. No more real check ups. no more time to explain your problem. No more real examinations Oh, there is on paper or in the computer so health care workers, even Doctors just make sure they cover their butts, to the point of out right lying!!! Make it look like things were done just to collect the fees. The lawyers are partially to blame also with their ambulance chasing and advertising for frivolous malpractice suits.

A lot of us feel like we are on our own and no matter what doctor you go to we are not being treated, just pushed thru the system as fast as possible. Many, many mistakes are being made. No one, including doctors and nurses seem to know what they are doing. It is not their fault. They are not being properly taught and trained, just shoved thru school and paying exorbitant rates to do it. Something I use to love so very much has become something very ugly and I hate it.

Now that l am sitting up l reached forward to grab my pajamies,Before i was able to look at my pj\\\"s fully, i was 50% sure that the wetness that i felt the 1st time with my hand is that i had a accident in my sleep(I PISSED MYSELF)!!

How to confirm HIV?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hi. Thanks for providing the clinical pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would try to provide you with the best possible answers to your questions. The symptoms you have mentioned for example fever, general feeling of not being well, vague body aches may be a hint of acute HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) syndrome. They may also, in reality, be hypochondriacal that is due to stress and you are giving a lot of importance to them. The skin eruption that you mentioned and the pictures are suggestive of urticaria or hives. This may also see even as a response to mild fever or medicines that you may have taken or may even erupt in absolutely healthy people. Itchiness without any lesions in the groin area may be due to sweat, exacerbated by stress levels. The prominence of tongue swelling is nothing abnormal. They are the normal lingual papillae which mean that normal texture of the tongue present in all. When a person is psychologically stressed, often these normal tongue markings are interpreted as being abnormal. So, do not worry about this. Genital discharge you mentioned may or may not be normal. You must attend an STD (sexually transmitted disease) or STI (sexually transmitted infection) specialist to get yourself checked for the discharge, which may be a sign of urethritis - infection of the urethra. For this, a urethral swab or swab dipped in the discharge will be taken to rule out. Having said that, the possibility of acute HIV syndrome cannot be ruled out with 100% certainty based on these symptoms, although apparently, the chances are too low. Yes, you can contract HIV even from a single exposure. The risk is moderate, from being the passive partner and allowing unprotected intercourse and passage of your partner's seminal fluid into your anorectal mucosa. Further, your partner agreed to have been promiscuous himself. A rapid HIV test is just a modification of the standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. The only difference between rapid and standard HIV test is that the results are given out within 20-30 minutes of having given the blood sample in rapid test module whereas have to wait for a period of a week for the results in the standard test protocol. The more confirmatory test would be a western blot or p24 antigen assay or HIV RNA PCR. These tests can confirm or rule out HIV within a maximum of 12 days of the last suspected exposure. So, get them done to put your mind at peace. My final advice does not panic.", "start_char_idx": 566703, "end_char_idx": 570935, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57612e1f-53a4-4bd1-9ccf-8de5a835ed40": {"__data__": {"id_": "57612e1f-53a4-4bd1-9ccf-8de5a835ed40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bac285bb-be5b-430b-8f2d-943b2d8ec69e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "f5d26cd8910f6a8e11b3d8af942be14999db551c32c2fc8bfbbf3aa8e4a51417", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83bf42a0-cbbf-425d-8f4e-907d50793b1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe6a06b4d0aff9153170ed8df9d02e5323c55315a6a648f17b1ac85ae2401299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Yes, you can contract HIV even from a single exposure.

So, get them done to put your mind at peace. My final advice does not panic. Visit an STD-HIV specialist as soon as possible for evaluation of the genital discharge and request to get the fourth generation test done. Also, the additional blood tests mentioned below. Get back to us with the report of these tests and take treatment for urethritis, if it is confirmed. No need to panic even if your fourth generation test comes out positive for HIV. It takes an average of 10 years for HIV positivity to convert into AIDS syndrome. And with a healthy lifestyle, positive thinking and available anti-HIV drugs, most patients who have full-blown AIDS, are also able to live healthy in the present medical era. Have you been vaccinated for hepatitis B? You must get tested for hep B and C and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) syphilis. If you have not been vaccinated for hep B, get vaccinated as soon as possible. Maintain good oral hygiene. Your tongue seems to be coated due to lack of oral hygiene. Use a mild cleansing mouth wash and also get your tongue swab tested for fungus. 1. Fourth generation HIV testing assay. 2. Western blot test. 3. Urethral discharge or urethral swab evaluation for gonococcal and non-gonococcal infections. 4. Additional blood tests - serology for hepatitis B (HBsAg -hepatitis B surface antigen test) and hepatitis C (Anti-HCV - hepatitis C virus antibodies), VDRL. 5. Tongue swab for fungus. Always use protection in the form of condom for any sexual activity. Never trust any sexual partner about his/her promiscuous nature or HIV status.  \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hi doctor, I had unprotected anal and oral sex with a guy. This makes me very stressful. The symptoms I encounter after the incident are as follows. I am feeling very tired from day 10, and I think it as stress. From day 12, I am having some sort of difficulty in breathing and numbness all over the body. On day 14, I have experienced itch inside the penis with clear watery discharge like urine, and it lasted only for a few days. On day 17, I had fever and headache which was cured in a day with treatment. I got an itchy rash on the chest, back, face and scalp on the 19th day. It lasted for about five days and got reduced, but still remains some. Then other symptoms persist till date which occurred gradually are sore throat, lower back pain, abdominal pain, joint pain, coating on tongue, bumps on back of tongue, red spot on tongue with irritation, itchy legs and hands without rash, blurred vision, painful itchy and sore armpit, thigh, genital area and buttock areas. I have attached the photos, please have a look. Do these symptoms suggest acute HIV infection? Or can it be other STDs? I have undergone the following tests to check HIV. Rapid blood test on day 19 and the result was negative, and I repeated the same test on day 35 and that too negative. My partner tested in front of me one day before sex, and it was negative. He claimed that he is clear and safe. But, he said that he had one partner three or four months ago and also many partners before. If my partner is truly clear and safe and I am HIV negative, then what cause all these symptoms? My doctor said I have very similar symptoms of acute HIV which makes me freaked out and nervous. I made mistake to have unprotected sex with him. I am going to get married soon. I will decide my marriage according to my HIV test result only. Please answer my questions and give advice.

Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Ones depression settles down, alcohol abuse will also come down. Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hi there Dr. Rynne , I am a 45 yr old female, w/ genetic genes w/ mental illness mostly depression, and BP.

Ok, it all started once when i was taking a shower, i almost faint because of the steam. This happened in november, and i could be fine in school until december, although i had some weird feelings which were related to the fear. Well, this fear wasnt that big, but when i finished school (december, i live in south america) i started to think: Anything can happen anytime, i better take care of my body and i started to overprotect it, like a hypocondriac, i felt some days i couldnt breath , one night, i really couldnt breath, i couldnt move, i was sweating, i was shaking, but yet, i dont know why i didnt ask for help. Ok so i managed to fell asleep and when i woke up i didnt have any of the sypmtoms just a little bit of nerviosism. After this i felt good for 1 week, when it started again, the feeling that i couldnt breath, so i told my mom and she took me to a doctor, he examinated me and said my heart and lungs were ok, very well, i was so happy it wasnt something physical but i told my dad, and instead of saying Thats great son!, he just told me But i dont think its that, i think its because you spend too much time on the computer This saddened me. Ok, i kept with my live until one day, my feelings returned, but this time it was in the morning, couldnt breath, sweating, etc. And my parents were crying because they said Oh how can we help him, we do not have money That worried me and the symptoms got much worse, we had to go to urgency, the medic who first examinated me, told me my problem was in my mind, and just to be sure, i got torax x-rays and an ECG because i had some discomfort in the left armpit. Both exams were ok, and i went home. Since then i felt better, but other symptoms appared, this time, weird feelings when i stood from a chair, like a pressure going up from my chest , it dissapeared in 3 seconds but it was discomfortable, i also had some discomfort at the sides of the forehead, i couldnt stand up sometimes. The worst of all is that my parents didnt believe me, they thought i was creating all this because i wanted, AND I WAS ON VACATION, why would i do that? But they kept not believing me, i didnt know how to act, if i showed a sign of my discomfort my parents would ground me. Some time happened and those symptoms dissapeared: the feelings on the sides of the forehead and the pressure going up. Some days later, i started to get like a vacuum on my heart zone, it was not pain, it didnt irradiate. I had some in my lyfe, like 1 per 2 years, and i didnt really care about it, but now i had 6 per DAY, and obviously, my parents were mad at me, but one night, i was shaking and sweating again, i could breath, but those heart sensations came every 15 minutes, and my mom was yelling at me that she didnt want me anymore to be her son, that because of me she had all her problems, and i didnt cry because i was worried about my heart, after 2 hours, my mom told me she would take me to the doctor. At the next day the doctor told me my problem could be intestinal, so i had a panendoscopy, which said i had gastritis , duodenitis, and the helycobacter pyrali, i started an antibiotic treatment, and the bacter dissapeared, all good there, but now i have other symptoms BUT, i assume my problem is my mind, i know im overprotecting my body with every thing i feel, i recognize it and im with a psychologist , im getting over it, but yet, i have some feelings and i attribute them to diseases.", "start_char_idx": 580634, "end_char_idx": 584707, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2292f98d-bf47-4b62-ba07-af6eb037b832": {"__data__": {"id_": "2292f98d-bf47-4b62-ba07-af6eb037b832", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b06953d1-a5f0-4912-a574-a9cac53e919e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "65855550ea9a73cdcb3fe1551bcab53a00fc49f9afcbc33e29a29707f491a85f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bacce24-f000-4633-99b3-72da8045c2c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "296317dbe3eaae6c79a9d299cd505e59f17907463285001f32c2ae6d9156115d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At the next day the doctor told me my problem could be intestinal, so i had a panendoscopy, which said i had gastritis , duodenitis, and the helycobacter pyrali, i started an antibiotic treatment, and the bacter dissapeared, all good there, but now i have other symptoms BUT, i assume my problem is my mind, i know im overprotecting my body with every thing i feel, i recognize it and im with a psychologist , im getting over it, but yet, i have some feelings and i attribute them to diseases.

Chemotherapy protocols are being updated every day but what your doctors have suggested is in the right direction. Treatment is usually with medicine like Carboplatin and Paclitaxel with some patients being given Cisplatin. Dysentry and diarrhea are known adverse effects of chemotherapy and occur in some patients. Weekly treatment is good as full-dose chemotherapy with comparable rates of response. Talking about single drug and multi durg options, every cancer is different and the treatment course is closely monitored and changes made appropriately. Every cancer patient is different and changes should be made after carefully studying the patient condition. In conclusion, as a patient relative you can help maintain a good general condition of the patient and give adequate fluids and nutrition. Side effects are uncertain and cannot be predicted. I hope this helps.  \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hello doctor, I would like to know about weekly chemotherapy for Peritoneal cancer of 76-year-old lady.

I am writing for my writing for my 76-year-old sister suffering primary peritoneal carcinoma. Before four years, one MD (Medicine) while treating her for asthma problem detected by clinical examination a huge lump in abdomen. He ordered for USG of lower abdomen and pelvis. The report says: Kidneys: Both kidneys are normal in size but maintains shape, outline, and position. Cortical echogenicity is increased with maintained corticomedullary differiention. No evidence of any hydronephrosis, renal calculus or mass lesion is seen. Right Kidney=7.4 cm, Left Kidney=7.5 cm. Ureter: Both ureters are not visualized hence not dilated. Urinary bladder: Urinary bladder is seen normal in size, shape and wall thickness. No intraluminal lesion is seen. Uterus and ovary: It is not visualized (removed in 1996). Suprapubic region mesentery is grossly thickened and appears as SOL (10.4X5.4 cm) with displaced bowel loop around it. Impression: 1. ?Mesenteric mass suggest CT scan 2. Bilateral small size kidneys with Grade I renal parenchymal changes. Next seen by an oncosurgeon. He ordered for noncontrast CT of upper abdomen (Noncontast because as her creatinine level was 1.9 compared to a maximum of 1.0 for females. CT scan of upper abdomen done and report shows: The liver is of normal in size and is of normal contour and attenuation. No IHBR dilation. Gallbladder is well distended with normal wall thickness. Pancreas is normal in size and attenuation. Peripancreatic fat planes normal. MPD not dilated. Spleen is of normal size, contour and attenuation. No focal lesions. Sections through the lower abdomen show omental fat stranding and nodularity. The Bilateral kidneys are mildly contracted. The pelvicalyceal system are normal. Adrenals are seen. No evidence of any focal lesions. No evidence of ascites. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted. Visualized bowel loops reveal normal in position, caliber, and wall thickness. Scoliosis noted with convexity towards left side. Impression: Omental stranding and nodularity. The surgeon also asked for contrast enhance MRI of pelvis. The report shows: MRI report patient postoperative case of ovarian malignancy (no documents available). Study reveals omental thickening and nodularity (caking). There is a focal protrusion of the omentum through a defect in the umbilicus (? postoperative). Post Contrast study shows enhancement of the omentum. DWI images show restricted diffusion within the omentum. No abnormal lymphadenopathy seen. Bones under review are are within normal limits. Uterus and ovaries are not visualized (postoperative). There are minimal pelvic ascites. On post Contrast study thin smooth peritoneal enhancement is seen with few nodules at places. Enhancement is also noted along the sigmoid and descending colon. Impression: Nodular cake like omental thickening, smooth peritoneal enhancement with nodularity at places in a patient with previous malignancy features suggest possibility of peritoneal carcinomatosis. (advise-omental biopsy) Next core needle biopsy from omental mass was ordered. The report shows: USG guided core biopsy from Omental mass.

I have forwarded to you four reports in respect of her for USG, CT scan, MRI, biopsy. Probably she is suffering from extra ovarian primary peritoneal cancer (EOPCC) which happens to candidates whose ovary/uterus already removed. For her Hysterectomy was done some 20 years back when biopsy report was normal. Please also note that her CA 125 is 2948 almost 80 times the normal value. Please intimate me in short whether any first dose of chemotherapy given caused heavy side effects like acute dysentery/diarrhea for her? Whether at this age of 76 chemo with one single drug is advisable? As per discussion with doctors here this peritoneal cancer resembles almost like ovarian cancer (treatment mode also same), although ovary removed some 20 years back.\",\n        \"email\": \"mmnymk@yahoo.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"4228377109\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 9890,\n        \"Description\": \"Q. My friend had a spinal injury and walked after that, but passed away after two days. Why?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. 1. Yes, the fall seems to be the cause of the fractured neck and the damage to his spinal cord (attachment removed to protect patient identity). 2. Nothing would have changed if you found him one or two hours before. 3. I think that the fall caused the vertebral column fracture. Then, during transport to the hospital, the instability of the vertebral column has to lead to compression of the spinal cord, probably due to a wrong posture. 4. As he had tingling in his legs and could not feel them, these are signs of a spinal cord injury, probably in the posterior part where the sensory columns lay. A person with partial spinal cord damage can walk if the motor pathways in the anterior spinal cord are not damaged. But there is no way to know if he had broken his neck because he had no neck pain. So, it seems that this was a fatal injury. He should not have walked, but even if this did not happen, I am not sure if he could survive. You should know that the most important thing after a spinal cord injury is the swelling of the spinal cord, which increases in size in the next days. That is why his situation worsened the following days. You should know that the respiratory heart nerve pathways and lay on the cervical spinal cord. So, probably as the spinal cord has been swelling in the next days, it has affected this area, causing his death. There is no way to predict that if something changed in the management of the situation, it would make him live. This is because cervical spinal cord injuries have a high mortality rate and poor outcome. I hope you will find this information helpful.

He was trying to get up out of the ditch, and he could raise his head off the floor and his upper body slightly but not pull himself upright and out of the ditch. He wanted me to pull him up and out of the ditch. First of all, I assessed what injuries he thought he had, he had no pain in his head, neck or back, but thought he had broken his arm after smashing it against the side of the ditch as he landed. I decided not to pull him up in case he had any other injuries, so I phoned for the ambulance. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, my friend said he had a strange tingling sensation in his legs. A paramedic arrived first before the ambulance, and he assessed my friend for any injuries. The paramedic then decided to get my friend out of the ditch, and as he was trying to get him out of the ditch, my friend said he could not feel his legs despite being to move them. The paramedic eventually got my friend out of the ditch and sat him down on a seat. The ambulance arrived, and instead of escorting my friend into the ambulance on a stretcher, the paramedic walked my friend into the ambulance. My friend walked from his back garden, down some small steps, and a sloping drive into the ambulance, covering a distance of about 40 meters. His arm was in a sling, and he was walking at a steady pace, but from what I saw, the balance was normal. It was when he was taken to the hospital that he was diagnosed with a fractured neck and died a few days later from transection of the cervical spinal cord. There was an inquest into his death, which I could not attend, where there was a verdict of accidental death. There are some questions I would like to ask about his injuries, please. He had no close family, so I can not ask them, and the coroners service can not give me any information because I am not related to him, and it is confidential information.So I would appreciate it if you could answer these questions, and I would particularly I like to know if there was any more I could have done to help him. The questions are, (1.) Did the fall cause the transection of the spinal cord the moment he fell and fractured his neck? (2.) If that was the situation would he have not survived even if I found him straight after his fall, and not 1 to 1 1/2 hours later, and also if he was kept immobilized and not walked after the fall would it be the case he would not have survived. (3.) Or would the fall have not caused the transaction of the spinal cord the moment he fractured his neck, and it was the period after the fall when lying in the ditch and moving around trying to get himself up that may be an unstable, broken bone in his neck struck his spinal cord and severed it? (4.) Or would the fall have only caused a slight spinal cord injury and if I found quicker and he was kept immobilized he could have survived? (5.) While waiting for the ambulance to arrive my friend said he had a strange tingling sensation in his legs and also when the paramedic was trying to get him out of the ditch, my friend said he could not feel his legs despite being able to move them, were the signs he had a spinal cord injury at that time? (6.) If my friend had severe injury his spinal cord when he fell or the time afterward, how could he have managed to walk into the ambulance 2 to 2 1/2 hours after the fall? (7.) Would it have been the walking that caused the most damage to his spinal cord? (8.)

I should clarify that I should not suggest you any test for cardiac evaluation. These can be best suggested by cardiologists only. From your detailed workup, I can assume that at least two cardiologists believe that you are not having any significant heart disease at present. 2. I would like to know especially more about your allergies and asthma. This is because asthma can cause chest pains, an acute episode can cause even chest tightness. Not only that, an entity called \\\"GERD\\\" (gastroesophageal reflux disease) may be associated with asthma and it can cause burning type of chest pains.3. Hence, I would not interfere with your cardiac workup, but I would like to know - a. Since what age do you have asthma? What are the symptoms? What is the frequency of your symptoms? How you manage it? How was your asthma diagnosed?b. What are your nose/sinus symptoms? Do you have running nose, sneezing, nose obstruction, headache, facial heaviness, repeated throat clearing, etc? c. Do you have any symptoms like - regurgitation of sour fluids/foods after taking meals, especially after heavy/spicy meals or after lying down? Do you have sensation of nausea or vomit frequently?d. What are the medications that you frequently use or have used so far for allergies and asthma? What are any other medications that you use frequently/regularly?e. Is stress an important factor in your life?f. How is your digestion in general? DO you have repeated abdomen pains, constipation or diarrhoea?4. Above things are very important as - some of the asthma medications can cause palpitations, some of the asthma medications can worsen GERD. I would like to know whether you can correlate your symptoms with any particular drug/food intake.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards. \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Dear Doctor,   I am 31 years old, male living in Mumbai. I have had a brief history of heart diagnostic starting a year ago. I had applied for a life insurance policy with SBI for which I was asked to get a health check up done at a reputed hospital in Mumbai. The cardiologist over there took my ECG and said that he cannot do a stress test as I was suffering from a heart disease 'cardiomyopathy' and he said 'my heart is growing in size and I will need a heart transplant 10-15 years later'.

As it so happened, the pain continued to come on and off. In the meantime, my father was diagnosed with liver cancer and I shifted base to Bangalore. Since I was getting these pains, I wanted to get them checked thoroughly and went to a cardiologist in Bangalore. He saw the reports and said the same thing that it is likely to be false positive. He did an echo test and said it was very likely false positive. He also said that if the pain continues, he will recommend a stress myoview. Unfortunately my father passed away within three months of diagnosis and I moved back to Mumbai. I visited the doctor again as I started getting palpitations and the pain continued to come. He said that it must be due to stress and he continues to think it is false positive. He however said that for my own comfort, I should get a CT-angiography done.

Let me explain you about my pain: 1. It comes at various ponts on the left chest 2. Sometimes it is a burning sensation, sometimes squeezing, sometimes pains the way a wound would pain 3. The pain is off and on - average 4-5 times a week and lasts for a few seconds 4. Sometimes when I exhale, I get a pain along a column inside the chest. Feels as if something is rubbing 5. It has never been severe; mild pain and I continue to do my daily work as usual 6. I dont remember getting any chest pain while excercising. 7. At times when it pains, I feel like moving my chest to avoid pain.  Can you please help me with what can be the cause for my pain and which test should I go for to know whether I have any heart disease or if yes, what is it? I have been an athletic individual for a long time. In the last 8-10 weeks, I feel my heart is pounding very hard and I can feel my heart beat a lot. I can see the left part of my chest shakes rhythmically with the heart beat.  Please do let me know if you need any other information regarding my problem.

You have tendency for BP elevation due to your genetic make up which is part of PCOS, etc. How much do you weigh? Also, your psychological issues tend to worsen BP. BP may rise during exercising and considering your high BP tendency, it may excessively rise during exercising. Other factors which can worsen BP is stress, high salt intake like pickles, NSAIDS like Brufen or other pain killers, migraine medicines or even any pain can worsen BP. So, avoid pain killers other than Paracetamol or Tramadol, plenty of fruits, have low salt diet, regular exercises, try to keep weight under control. If BP elevates then you may have an additional dose of Telmisartan. Maximum you may up-to 80 mg in a day. Also, while taking BP readings, you should keep your arm relaxed, take 2-3 readings at a time and take BP after rest of 5-10 min. If BP is rising persistently in the evening then additional dose of Telmisartan may be added in the afternoon 2 hours before the expected BP rise. Your average in last abpm was fine and occasional high readings are not worrisome. Regarding inflammation, best way to settle inflammation is healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high calorie diet. Having regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to capacity. Also, you should get your lipid profile done and statins like Rosuvastatin prescribed to settle this inflammation. Dinner should be light. Now, regarding your stroke risk, it is better to get a neurologist opinion. The changes may be related to inadequate BP in the past, but you should also obtain carotid artery Doppler for source of emboli. Also, transesophageal echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of patent formanen ovale as a source of emboli.  \",\n        \"Patient\": \"Hello doctor, I am 42 years old, single parent with two kids aged 15 and 10.

First and foremost i cannot make any definitive decisions or a definitive diagnosis without considering your full history and undertaking a full examination, but i will use to above information to try and advice you accordingly.  Pain around a tooth can either originate from the tooth itself or from the tissues surrounding the tooth.  1 - If the pain originates from the tooth itself it is usually either due to decay which is encroaching onto the pulp (the nerve chamber) or the filling is so deep that it is close to the nerve and some of the constituents of the filling material are stimulating pain as they find their way through the dentinal tubules into the nerve chamber. Another possibility is that a composite resin material was used (white filling) and as it contracts when cured (hardened) it pulls against the walls of the cavity which causes pain. One final posibility is that you may have a fracture through the tooth. I know you say this was ruled out, but in fact it is very difficult to rule out fractres in teeth. They certainly dont show up very well on radiographs (xrays) and they are hard to identificy clinically (in the mouth) unless they are extensive. I would like to see the radiographs if possible. Solutions to the above problems involve removing the existing filling, check the base of the cavity, placing a sedative dressing in the cavity for a week to see how things resolved. This sedative dressing is made of Zinc Oxide Eugenol. If this temporary dressing works, then we can confirm that the pain is tooth-borne and a result of the size of the filling and its proximity to pulp (nerve chamber).", "start_char_idx": 608096, "end_char_idx": 612336, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9e08121-08ef-4443-bf01-b1715015abb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9e08121-08ef-4443-bf01-b1715015abb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ba8382b-1f6e-4858-87e6-71f14f431781", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "c6b80838f2209bc0b5558cf374fe6aa5b6c9820a0e692d0ceda0a80ef5b8d964", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ead926ac-4f82-45b7-9050-6374630d73f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8725e70ed1cd0cabdbdc003f909fa6cdf8e30fee6fb84d84b19910873c0451e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "One final posibility is that you may have a fracture through the tooth.

If this temporary dressing works, then we can confirm that the pain is tooth-borne and a result of the size of the filling and its proximity to pulp (nerve chamber). If the temporary dressing does not relieve the pain then it is likely that the pain is either due to a fracture or no longer tooth-borne and the pain involves problems with the periodontal ligament (the tissue surround the tooth).  2-  If the pain originates from the surrounding tissues it means that your nerve is damaged beyond repair and their is resulting inflammation in the tissue at the end of the root. Typical symptoms of this include, continuous pain, throbbing pain, pain when pushing the tooth down into the socket, mobility of the tooth, swelling in the gum, etc. To treat this, one would have to undergo root canal therapy to remove the nerve tissue in the camber and canals and replace it with a resin material. This will then resolve the inflammation around the root of the tooth. An alternative and more definitive and more successful treatment option is to extract the tooth. For this we would have to be confident that the tooth was indeed non-vital (dead) due to irreparable damage to the nerve.  I would like to know the following:  1-What the xray looks like? 2- Does that pain wake you up at night? 3- What sort of pain - stabbing, shooting, dull ache, throb? 4- Is the pain continuous? 5- Does anything make it better? 6- Is it worse at any particular time during the day?

The filling was replaced but it fell out again and the dentist decided to readjust/enlarge the cavity so a new filling would stay. This procedure was done under local anaesthetic. Once the effect of the anaesthetic wore off, my tooth was very sensitive. I suffered very unpleasant sharp pain especially when drinking and eating either hot or cold. Back to the dentist to readjust the tooth (with carbon). But this didn t help. I gave it 10 days or so to see if time would heal and went back to the dentist. By that time I was using only my right side to chew . The dentist suspected that the filling was putting pressure on the tooth. They took the material away, investigated inside to check the root canal was alright and replaced the filing using less pressure (I think they also changed the type of material) and in two parts so it would impart less pressure. It did relieve the pain I was having to some extent but I was still experiencing pain regularly. Still chewing using the right side only, I began to develop pain in my jaw and cheek bones and basically, for a while, across all my teeth and my whole mouth. This lasted a week or more. I was taking pain killers (although with no efect) and had to blend my dinner as I couldn t chew properly because of the pain. Back to the dentist. I described all the symptoms mentioned above. The treated tooth was the source of the most pain: it was like biting a very small stone giving a sharp pain. Also I mentioned that food was concentrating between the tooth and its neighbouring second bicuspid and the resulting pressure was also giving sharp pain.

Don't take me wrong but I am just trying to figure out if any viral infection from the animal bad led to a sudden pain in the back and abdomen.also you have mentioned that he was cycling 15kms, BP, HR etc was all normal, it is never a sure that how a humam body reacts and behaves from time to time. so if the parameters are normal that doesnt mean always that the person may not have other symptoms. don't take me wrong on this statement of mine. I spend more time with geriatric patients aged between 60-100 so I have little understanding of the physical status and fluctuations of parameters which can misguide.since now the patient is paralyzed as per you mentioned in the history. is he totally paralyzed or half? what is the disability score of the patient?now looking to the treatment plan with the scenario to keep in mind I will request you to first make an arrangement of a physiotherapist who can help him by regular exercises ofcourse it will be passive and may help him to recover. also you should see that there is no formation of pressure sores of any infection to the patient. because that will directly affect the  metabolism and immune system of the body.if you can provide more inputs or give a detailed history of the patient from the time of arising of symptoms and till date I will be able to comment something. my mail and number will be available in the forum for which you can contact me.

One last time that i was there i was given an MMB and i thought i would DIE on the spot with the pain. So surgery is not gonna be done as I survived a car accident (head on during a seizure and/or anxiety attack). I had a rollover about 14-15 months and i have had a breast reduction hoping that my back would feel better, and it is still in the healing in process but my neck does feel better, My question is this: having been in a rollover as a very young girl (age 8) and then the two other car accidents, how do I find a good pain doctor who won t automatically ASSUME that I am out just finding drugs. I don t drink or do any medications that aren t mine and I don t know how to talk to my new PCP regarding my medications as well so my doctors are all on the same page.

I use only one pharmacy here in our town in Perryville, AR and I don t drive for safety of others. How do I approach either my doctor or a pain management doctor about possibly changing medications? I had a doctor for MANY years in Lonoke Arkansas but I divorced and moved to Perryville. If I hadn t totaled two cars out, I would drive myself to the doctors. I was on Medicaid previously, but had to go to the health marketplace for insurance since my disability just began the end of February this year and it is 84.00 a month. So how do I discuss this with a doctor and should I ask my doctor for a referral and possibly removed from the medication I take now? I also have a hematologist and I have to have iron transfusions and vitamins and minerals done monthly because my body won t absorb them. Today, I am two pints low on my blood. I have seen my hematologist/oncologist for about 15-19 years. How do I approach this going forward? A nurse that I know said that pain doctors will not accept me as a patient and I have a situation with the doctor saying to take ibuprofen and I cannot take that due to the fact that it is a blood thinner for me. Sleep? that is a joke. I haven t slept a solid and normal night in so many years I cannot recall. Sometimes I do get lucky and fall asleep, BUT I will wake within a couple of hours. I had been told I need a sleep study, but again, I don t drive and the hours that someone would have to drop me off for the test is usually in bed by 7pm because he is up at 3am for HIS job. My son just graduated high school and works full time. We have one gas station and one place to really eat so options are limited so I have time to arrange my appointments around other s schedules. Advice is definitely in need. I have Ambetter insurance. My email will be on this but I have things to do before I can lay down, In my recliner, as always. Thanks in advance for any help you doctors who can help me: I take Keppra for prevention of seizures, clonozapam for anxiety, Soma for back pain and spasms which are continuous (again my brother, at age 22 was a passenger in a wreck and paralyzed him until he passed away from sepsis at the age of 34), and the accident that I was involved as a little girl, my dad and I rolled the windows in our big Brady Bunch car from California to Arkansas and blessedly, since we both had our windows open, I got out by being thrown out of the car and alone down the revene, to be found when they took 9 hours to get him from the car and was paralyzed from 1975 and ultimately had to have his legs removed in 1977 from gangrene, so surgery is something I won t consider because I am the worrier in the family. I have two grandsons that I would l play with and trying to keeping eyes on both is almost impossible, considering they are 1 and 2. Again, any response to my email would be gratefully appreciated.

It arises from alterations in bile flow due to loss of the reservoir function of the gallbladder. Two types of problems may arise. The first is continuously increased bile flow into the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may contribute to esophagitis and gastritis. The second is related to the lower GI tract, where diarrhea and colicky lower abdominal pain may resultTreatment should be governed by the specific diagnosis made and may include pharmacologic or surgical approaches. First, you should do gastroscopy and ct scan to rule out other diagnoses and then ttreatment can be planned.I hope I have answered you query.

I moved into an older house that had really poor ventilation. As a result, when it was warmer inside than outside, I had condensation on my walls and water beaded down. So, soon after I moved in, mold grew on three of my bedroom walls. I had to clean the walls every week with bleach. During this time, I began to get rashes and eczema on my hand and on my legs. They were constantly dry and itchy and I unconsciously itched them until they bled. Seven months later, I also had extremely dry skin around my right eye which was red and itchy. I unconsciously rubbed the area which caused it to become inflamed and become swollen to the point it affected my vision a bit.  To treat my rashes, I applied cream to my legs and hands every few hours. For my eye, I applied cream every hour and got eye drops. I also tried Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.5% on my hands. I had a rash from poison oak previously. This prescription cream prevented the itchiness but caused it to dry out enough to start peeling, cracking and bleeding. So I stopped using the prescription cream and just used a regular cream for all my rashes. After about a week of using cream, the skin around my eye returned to normal but I had to still apply cream to ensure it did not dry out and peel.The problem is that I still have a huge rash on my hand and up and down my legs. It has gotten extremely bad as I constantly have scabs or bleeding wounds on my legs from itching or they have puss oozing out. For the past couple weeks, I have been waking up five to six times before my alarm to find I am itching my rashes. Now the rashes seemed to have spread as well. They began on my lower legs and have since spread to the entirety of my legs. My hand rashes started small the size of a penny. Now it is the size of a dollar coin. It also seems to have spread up to my wrist and maybe starting on my other arm as well. I thought of many what could be the cause of my rashes but I do not have many ideas.  Could it be an allergic reaction to the mold from my walls because it started during this time? But, I still have the rashes almost a month after the mold had stopped growing. The mold spores could still be on the walls or the environment.   Could I be allergic to the cream? I have used this cream for the past two or three years.   Could I be allergic to the shampoo or the soap? I have had the same bottles for past nine months, two months before the rashes started.   Could I be allergic to bed sheets? I have the same bed sheets for the past seven months.   Could I be allergic to food or milk? I cook all my food and have not had any steady foods that I had not already been eating before. I thought maybe I could be lactose tolerant. Of note, my both parents are and it started around the time they were in college so I cut out dairy for two weeks, but nothing changed.   Could it be allergies to pollen? I thought maybe I was allergic to the mold in the winter and now that it was spring, I was allergic to pollen. But I have no symptoms of allergies than the rash.", "start_char_idx": 634634, "end_char_idx": 638826, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d4b2b0-38b4-4c6a-9b9c-04862589ed68": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d4b2b0-38b4-4c6a-9b9c-04862589ed68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abae56bc-7e39-4481-a861-003e3037a436", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "0f2d50a798d0258c607f87f23bb41a7446be49e33f235238df41333318513a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab777fc2-7cee-4d13-a716-c1ed128db0e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "test\\top_100_entries.txt", "file_name": "top_100_entries.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 717510, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-06-10"}, "hash": "76cb71cb99ea11b82abd37646032f35e7346922449dd3b85b78290a6ff3bd318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5175536-04e8-4e98-a7a9-16c9ee4b9a7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b365ed2a9b68589e3d075c9368c095afe3efecdbdebc616f663996e5d1770e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Could I be allergic to the cream?

I would like to request your kind review for some of her recent symptoms as well, which I try to summarize below along with brief history. Early this year, she had a fever (100 to 101 F) with cold and was on Calpol 650 and Cetirizine for a few days. One morning, right after breakfast, while sitting on a chair, she started feeling reeling of the head along with darkness in both eyes, which resolved on its own after she went to bed and laid down. The same evening, when the doctor visited her for fever, her BP was 130/80 (left arm - sitting position) with pulse 102.

The same evening, when the doctor visited her for fever, her BP was 130/80 (left arm - sitting position) with pulse 102. She also had a left-sided headache, which took two to three days to settle down along with Calpol 650. Two months later - This time she was too worried about her son's health and recovery and night sleep was affected for a couple of days. She herself was also not too well due to stomach issues, antibiotic, gastritis, lack of appetite, etc. One morning, she started having running nose along with some amount of sneezing, for which she had taken a couple of Cetirizine tablets that day. The next day, right after lunch, while being in the sitting position itself and talking about her son's health issues, suddenly she reported to feel reeling of the head along with darkness in both eyes, followed by she was bent towards her left with left-hand palm shaking for 10 to 15 sec and was almost about to fall down, which however did not happen with help from others. We felt for next 5 minutes or so she was in an altered consciousness, staring at something silently, although the rest of us got extremely anxious. When we tried to speak to her, she was initially making some strange sounds, followed by normal words in hoarse voice and after that she started talking normally. However, she was crying and worrying about her son's health, although my wife was trying to console her. Later she mentioned not to have any memory of the whole incident, except the last part of consolation from my wife. She was back in normal activities in next 10 minutes, but reported to feel too tired and sleepy for at least next two weeks. As per doctor's appointment, I took her to our medicine doctor after five to six days of the incident, who classified this as a case of viral infection, noted BP 118/82 (right arm - sleeping position) and 'no H/O convulsion'. After a week of the incident, she had four times motion (not loose motion although) on an evening and started feeling headache after that. On the next morning, she reported feeling heaviness in legs as well as the head, which was, in fact, disturbing her daily activities. When we talked to the doctor, he advised testing serum sodium (138.4) and potassium (3.72) levels, which were normal. With rest, she improved in the evening and was able to get back into regular routine. In the following few months she had only one instance of reeling of head which happened in the morning and got cured on its own. She also had fever with cold sometime in the middle of the year, which caused her a left-sided headache, which also lasted for three to four days in spite of taking Calpol 650. Most of her BP readings during this period were around 110/80 (left arm - sitting position) and 120/72 (right arm - sleeping position), which prompted the doctor to change BP medicine to Stamlo 2.5 mg. However, due to slight swelling in feet after a month, it was changed back to Olmezest 20 mg. Around two months ago, some of her previous issues such as gastritis, constipation, three-four times of motion resumed back. One day she woke up pretty early (4.30 AM) and felt a significant amount of reeling of the head, which lasted almost 10 minutes, before settling on its own. She also had a left-sided headache, which again took three days to settle down, even after taking Calpol 650. She visited the doctor within next few days, who noted BP 132/82 (right arm - sleeping position) and mentioned the headache symptoms are clinically similar a migraine. The doctor suggested taking Olmezest 20 mg twice daily as her BP seemed a little higher as compared to the previous readings. He also advised for CT scan and Holter monitor for 24 hours, in case there are recurrences of reeling of head, seizure or presyncope. I have also uploaded her past six months of test reports for your kind review. She also started feeling mild to moderate pain in the waist joint (middle portion) since past one month, but I am not sure if that is relevant to our current discussion.

What kind of bee I do not know. That afternoon I was taken to hospital with a temp of 106 and subsequently diagnosed after some time with osteomyleitis. They were stumped for awhile. This was in the mid 1950 s. They always said the bee sting had nothing to do with the osteomyleitis. I almost died several times and was in hostilal for over a month and a half,developing pneumonia after I had been stable. Since,I have had terrible trouble with the leg the sting occurred,we think from damage to the illiac vein when dealing with the bone. I had developed vercosities,had a vein stripping at 19years old,a clot in the illiac in 1984 and again in 1996 that caused the vein to collapse. Since,I have become seriously disabled from the neuropathy,poor circulation and many other domino effects of the illiac vein having collapsed and no longer doing its job in my circulatory system. I am now 60 years old. I guess it s moot at this point,but I avoid bees and have never been stung since! I can t imagine that the two are not connected. I don t blame the problems with the vein,since the doctors saved my life. It was possibly nicked at some point,causing scare tissue and resulting clots. Problems with continuity because of insurance changes,even though I was employed consistently as a social worker full time and always had insurance,contributed to having several differant doctors during the time between clots etc... Since,nobody wants to deal with why,or says we don t know??? I have always been curious if anyone has seen osteomyleitis after a sting,since I ve been told it wasn t the cause. Never had a break etc... The resulting lose of the illiac is the current concern,but I m told nothing can be done about it. I have trouble walking, sitting,standing,lying, and am in terrible pain and discomfort ,but I have gotten use to it,as much a s one can,since the initial diagnosis in 1996,when a cat scan found the collapsed iliac vein. It took awhile for the debilitation to show up. But any ideas for that problem will be met with open ears...lol. But seriously it has ruined any chance for a normal life since I was in my early 40 s. I wrote about the curious origin of the osteomyleitis since it was never discovered and I m told it doesn t appear for no reason.\",\n        \"email\": \"veevhs@outlook.com\",\n        \"phone_number\": \"7332502070\"\n    },\n  \n    {\n        \"id\": 16880,\n        \"Description\": \"Q.

I am a father of two, height is six feet and weighing 87 kg. I was suffering from mild constipation (first poop is easy but clearing remaining used to take some time from past few months. I used to spend at least 15-20 minutes in loo. This is when I observed urine retention and mild constipation). From past few months, even my rectum was paining. History of UTI: It all started with severe pain after the passage of urine five months back. It was diagnosed as seminal vesiculitis and urologist said that it is common among men and advised sitz bath whenever it pains and advised me to have sex regularly. Though sitting in hot water tub helped me and it relieved me from pain, but the pain was recurring every 20 to 30 days. This continued for almost 18 months. Four months back, I had few drinks (I never consumed alcohol earlier) continuously for a few days, and that triggered severe pain after urination. One day it was so severe that I noticed blood in urine (hematuria) and urination was very frequent on that day. I suffered from fever also that day. The very next day I went to a urologist and got it diagnosed. This time my doctor advised for the following lab test: Hemogram (automated), glucose \u2013 random, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine \u2013 serum, urine routine, microscopy (qualitative method), urine culture, imaging \u2013 ultrasound abdomen (including post void residue) and uroflowmetry.

require medical attention. because of the severity of my light-sensitivity, my condition is now life-threatening. the shortest wavelengths of light i can tolerate are in the yellow-green to emerald green range, which is consistent with VP. any wavelength shorter than emerald green causes me immediate burning sensations in my skin, general nervous agitation and anxiety, and a hot, swelling sensation in my chest and abdominal cavity. exposure to any source of white light is in most cases immediately painful, and exposure for more than half hour causes cramping, writhing, and ultimately a

causes aching pain in my facial bones, eye pain and increased pussing, and facial redness and burning sensations. i have similar problems with the television. unfortunately, i have not been diagnosed. i did not know about photosensitivity diseases or my family history until my disease became very severe in 28, and the two tests i have undergone (once at age 30, again at age 39) were ordered by general physicians; both tests were botched. the first physician ordered the wrong series of tests (for erythropoietic rather than hepatic porphyrias), and the second physician excluded some tests that may have given a positive result (specific fluorescence test to confirm or rule out VP, possibly others). i spoke with a hematologist when i was not insured several years ago, and he gave me a runaround, telling me that diagnosis was unnecessary because there was nothing i could do about it but avoid sunlight, and that i should donate blood as a method of suppressing the attacks and porphyrin damage, which is contraindicated for VP and HCP. i have had great difficulty finding a specialist in my area that will take Medi-Cal (i live in redding, northern california). i am 41, and i know from my research that older sufferers often get false positives. can anyone recommend a qualified physician or hospital that will take my case either for medi-cal or as a charity case? i ve heard of a hospital back east (new york? pennsylvania?) that takes mystery disease charity cases on an inpatient basis for in-depth observation and testing. have any of you heard of this hospital, and would they take my case? for whatever reason, i cannot even establish myself as a patient with any general practitioners where i live, in redding, california. i have been turned away by all the local medical centers, although they accept medi-cal. when i was assessed for medi-cal, they sent me to a psychologist, who told them that without seeing any evidence of my claim (he was not given a copy of my medical files, which include photo documentation and witness references), that his uninformed opinion was that i was psychotic and delusional. i m guessing at this point that i am receiving medi-cal on the basis of his claims, as i did not receive any other assessment reports from my previous general practitioner (i recently moved, which is why i don t have a provider). it would appear to me that i am not being assisted because my illness has been falsely diagnosed as a delusion. is this a case of discrimination, and if so, what can i do about it? can anyone help me with this? with no diagnosis of my physiological condition and a false diagnosis of mental illness, i can t get SSI, i can t get an excuse note from a doctor to wear special protective clothing if i choose to seek

So the comprehensive stool analysis is well within normal limits-particularly calprotectin and lactoferrin which are inflammatory markers. Their absence theoretically excludes any inflammation within the bowel, hence a good finding. The MRE examination and its reporting is a subjective findings means it is interpreted by a radiologist and may sometime have an error in reporting because of differential enhancement pattern within bowel and bowel movements at the time of scan, plus given your colonoscopy report afterward also showed no pathology, suggest it was possibly an error in interpretation. The colonoscopy is however, the best modality to explain the MRE (magnetic resonance electrography) reported findings. Given normal colonoscopy suggest that the possibility of inflammation is unlikely. Now coming to your symptoms and use of medication that you believe helped for some time. From your history, I understand you have been given Mesalamine for the duration of seven months after a colonoscopy that showed colitis and biopsy showed non-specific inflammation. So first of all, Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory drug which is commonly being given among patient suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD is further classified into ulcerative colitis (UC) which is a superficial inflammation usually of large bowel starting down from rectum and goes above to involve large bowel. The other one is Crohn's disease (CD) which is somewhat deeper inflammation of the gut wall having a tendency to involve almost every part of the gut starting from the mouth toward the anus. Given your symptoms of mucus or pus discharge and presence of pancolitis on one of your colonoscopy make me think that there is a possibility of ulcerative colitis. Plus the response you observed to Mesalamine is also favoring this diagnosis. Your second colonoscopy did not show any inflammation, possibly because of the remission of the disease. The UC tend to have an intermittent course with flares and intervening remissions. Possibly at the time of second colonoscopy, the disease was in remission. Given your recent stool test and recent normal colonoscopy, make me think that you do not have active disease at the moment. Your disease seems to be controlled with Budesonide or previous Mesalamine you took. The mucus/pus discharge suggests that there may be some other problem such as anal fissure, anal fistula, or anal sinus which may accompany the ulcerative colitis in its course. For this, I want you to examine your perianal (bottom) area and see from where exactly the mucus is coming. The abdominal pain may be just because of stress and anxiety accompanying the current situation and not necessarily the active disease. For such pain SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are helpful. For treatment, I need to have the biopsy report of your colon (both the previous one and recent one), as I can see there is ongoing microscopic inflammation. Budesonide is an expensive drug and it is recommended in UC where the inflammation does not go beyond the left side of the colon. You had pan colitis (inflammation involving the whole colon) and that is why oral steroids such as tablet Prednisolone is more effective than Budesonide. The physician prescribes Budesonide over oral Prednisolone if the patient is unable to tolerate the systemic side effects which accompany oral Prednisolone, or patient has diabetes and bone mineral deficiency. Your physician probably kept this thing in mind. So to summarize: 1. You likely have ulcerative colitis because I did not see biopsy of your bowel, and as you said it was nonspecific. 2. The UC is in remission 3. The pus and mucus have to be closely examined by you or by a physician by doing a digital rectal examination. 4. The UC can frequently accompany depression and anxiety and that should be taken care of abdominal pain possibly related to stress and you consider taking SSRI at minimum dose like tablet Escitalopram 10 mg daily 5.

I have shoulder, arm, breast and neck pain. Is it musculoskeletal pain?\",\n        \"Doctor\": \"Hello. Firstly, it is not at all related to the heart. Cardiac pain usually increases on exertion and relieves with rest. It will never increase on pressing or arm movement. You do not need to repeat any test.  Coming to possibilities, psychosomatic is certainly a possibility, but considering the site of pain, there is also a possibility of a cervical spine problem. Do you have any tingling, numbness in arm, neck stiffness, increase in pain on neck movements, neck trauma in the past, etc,? If yes, it suggests the possibility of cervical spondylosis. So I think, it is worthwhile to get X-ray cervical spine done anteroposterior or lateral view. Just check, sometimes during CT head, they may include neck region as well. If yes, then no need of X-ray.  Regarding medicines, Tramadol is the safest as far as BP is concerned. However, it may not be that effective. You may try tablet Naproxen 250 mg two times a day after meals. Only problem is with this, in some (minor) patients, it may slightly raise BP which will come back to normal after it has stopped. So I think, it is worthwhile to try it. Also, you should try muscle relaxant tablet Myoril 4 mg whenever needed upto three times a day and look for a response. If gets a positive response then we can complete the course of five days. This should not cause any significant cardiac issues in you.

Sometimes, it pains on the back side as well. I can feel the pain when I press the body part where the pain originates. The pain aggravates when I press. There is no accompanied shortness of breath or sweating at all. Please note that pain may not be there in all the areas at the same time. Like for now, at this point in time, I only have very mild discomfort in front area near the shoulder and breast.Some of the points to consider for diagnosis:I am hypertensive. However, my BP is very well controlled (110/80) with Metoprolol and Amlodipine. I also take Atorvastatin 10 mg for cholesterol. I am now asked to stop Atorvastatin. I am on these medications since last one year. All my below tests (one year old) are normal. EKG.Chest X-ray.Brain CT scan.Pulmonary embolism.All blood works.48 hours Holter monitor.No murmur or gallop noticed.Arterial oxygen levels.Troponin levels.All my recent blood works (two months old) like lipid profiles, kidney function test, CBP, liver function test, HbA1c, vitamin profiles (vitamin D, B12, calcium, iron), sodium, potassium, urine exam are normal. I walk daily for 20 to 30 minutes. Occasionally, I run too and do not experience any pain. Sometimes, I take stairs and do not experience any shortness of breath or pain. I had a different variant of chest pain last year. I did EKG, TMT and 2D echo and results are normal findings. It was diagnosed with non-cardiac pain. I have some mild to moderate irrational anxiety (GAD) and I am not sure if the pain I am experiencing is of psychosomatic origin. I had my left shoulder dislocated some 20 years back. In last 20 years it dislocated almost 7 to 8 times of which four times, I had to go to the hospital and get it fixed non-surgically. All other times it got fixed on its own. Last time it dislocated was I am not sure if the pain is causing because of that. I was very poor in following the instructions about wearing a sling and all. I used to be sling free immediately after shoulder is replaced back. Although I never had any problem with my left shoulder or arm, I intermittently used to get some mild pain in shoulder and upper arm. My left hand is fully functional. Although, I am careful in not rotating it 360 with a fear that it might get dislocated.Currently, I do not have acidity so I think the pain does not seem to be related to GERD. 2D echo and TMT were done just one year back and returned normal, do I need to re-do these tests? Since then I believe things should have only been improved as I made a lot of lifestyle and dietary changes. BP is very much controlled. It is always 110/80, Resting heart rate is good too. 70 to 80 BPM. Lipid profile is normal. LDL (73), HDL (46), Total (145). If it is musculoskeletal pain, could you please suggest some medicine?

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should first be relax and calm. Get done ecg, chest x and 2d echo to rule out heart and lung diseases. If all these these are normal then no need to worry for major diseases. You all symptoms are mostly due to stress and anxiety related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, burning, chest pressure, tightness etc. GERD can also worsen asthma and bronchitis. So we should first control your stress and anxiety to control your GERD. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Avoif stress and tension, be relax and calm. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs for GERD. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have been taking 2 peptobismo chewbles a day, one in the morning, one at night, to help with acid reflux, and three Bayer s chewable asprins everynight, to help with rib and heart pain, and it worked for a while, but now its just nothing. I have also been getting ice cold on the inside, but hot on the outside. Breathing is so-so but its alright, but the pain in my ribs and heart hurt horribly everyday multiple times a day. I have also been somewhat stressing and may be gaining anxiety recently from all this, as I have never been sick this badly, so it s all new to me, and I had to go to the ER from an allergic reaction to a type of penicillin a week and two days ago, and this severe pain only started recently, on Jan. 29. The ER had given me Benadryl and a Cortiosteriod (May have miss spelt that) when I was there, and gave me more benadryl Take for 10 days as needed for allergy symptoms and I don t know if it meant I had to take them for 10 days, or when I had allergy symptoms. They gave me some more cortiosteroids to take two days after on Jan. 28. I did, and had a horrible pain attack that night, so I set up an appointment with my doctor on the 29. I went, and he ignored basically everything pain wise and didn t know about anything that was happening. In the car, the entire roof of my mouth was blue. Its been getting better from that, but its still slightly blue down the middle. I did a few errands, and by the time I got home, I was in so much pain, and then proceeded to have an asthma attack. Then ever since then, I had to take the solution once everyday, and the last 2-3 days I have had to take it more than one, ranging from twice to three times. I have tried exercising the past three/four days, where I go outside for a few minutes (5-10, really) and that really makes me feel better, but it always causes me to need the solution an hour or two afterwards. I also believe I am loosing large amounts of weight, which is slightly terrifying to me. I weighed myself early and as my normal weight was 180lbs before all this (The sickness has been going on for over a month now.) and I was 165lbs. I drink around 2-3 bottles of water a day, eat soup, a turkey and cheese sandwhich, some eggs and swiss cheese scrambled together with a tortillia and then bananas. Since I ve been having acid reflux, I stop eating large solid foods at 7pm, and stop eating in general and getting ready for bed around 10pm, but if I do feel extremely hungry (Which I ve been having problems with recently aswell) I eat a banana or some crackers. (Very few though, as I had a horrible reaction with acid reflux recently (When the heart palputations started, really) and thats also when I started getting really sicker and was pale yesterday,and in so much pain I almost fainted.

I was recently diagnosed with adult ADD but I do not think I really have it. Long story short: I mentioned to my doctor that I am forgetful & have trouble concentrating & asked what herbal remedy I could take for it. He referred me to a clinical psychologist. The psychologist decided I have ADD without much to go on. I couldn t believe that he came to that conclusion. I have a B.Ed & used to teach kids with ADHD as well as a Masters in Counseling Pyschology. My mother-in-law has adult ADD & so does my brother-in-law. So, I am very experienced with it. I have also taken several online ADD questionnaires with negative results. After receiving the report, my regular doctor prescribed Adderall 20mg XR. After reading what it does & researching for hours (and obviously still researching), I found a lot of off label uses for it...weight loss, Depression, Social Anxiety, even Chronic Fatigue. It s so hard to decipher from the internet what is fact & what is fiction. I have Chron s Disease & have had a bowel resection in the past. I am always B12 & iron deficient. I get regular B12 shots. I am always tired & I do not have a lot of energy. Getting up in the morning is extremely hard to do whether I ve had 3 hours of sleep or 10 hours. I am seeing a sleep specialist & he said I have Delayed Sleep Phase & tried me on several sleep medications to try to adjust my phase. I did not see any improvement & the specialist is going to schedule a day sleep study to assess my daytime fatigue (already did the night clinic) to decide if he is going to prescribe something to help with the daytime sleepiness. I have a very patient husband who usually takes the kids to school in the morning so I don t have to. We ve kind of settled into the roles of me being the creative, game board mother & him being the active, outdoors dad because I don t have the energy for it. My Chron s Disease is under control & I stopped taking Imuran in October 2011. However, I still have abdominal pain related to it. I have just learned to live with it. When I read about Adderall after my doctor prescribed it, I decided to try it. I may not have ADD but I have a lot of other ailments that might benefit. So, I started taking the 20mg capsule. What a difference! I only started it last week but my energy level has increased, I get out of bed before the alarm... without hitting snooze literally for a 1/2 hour. I wake my kids up instead of them trying to wake me up. I get tasks completed & cross a lot of things off my to-do list. I have not noticed any abdominal discomfort.

I only started it last week but my energy level has increased, I get out of bed before the alarm... without hitting snooze literally for a 1/2 hour.

I think that 20 mg is too high, though & I am going to ask to drop to 5mg, 10mg or 15mg. I just want to take the lowest possible amount that will increase my energy level, give me a higher tolerance for pain & solve my sleep problem. I have not had a problem falling asleep on Adderall, either. I take the pill early in the morning. So, I fall asleep at a normal time & get up at a normal time. Wow! I m almost 40 & have never done that! Sometimes I feel like I am just keeping my head above water because of my energy level. Adderall has genuinely helped me to function & accomplish daily tasks. Ok, that was the loooong history. I am getting to my question, I promise! I am worried about the long term side effects of Adderall. I am un upbeat person who has never suffered from depression but my mother, sister and brother have. Apparently that puts me at risk for depression and/or anxiety with Adderall use. Even with all my health issues & lack of energy, I m still an optomist & I do love life. My dad died at 43 of colon cancer when I was 16 so I learned at a young age to love every day. Adderall is an addictive drug but I have been on many addictive pain killers in the past, including morphine taken every morning with percocet for break through pain for 6 months before my bowel resection. I ve also taken drugs such a lortab over the years for flare-ups. These medications have always been prescribed by a doctor & I have never abused any of them. I have come off all without any addiction issues. I read that Adderall causes appetite suppression & weight loss. I am very conscious of that & I have made sure to eat regularly & I bought some Ensure shakes for back up. I do not want to lose weight & possibly cause trouble with my Chron s. I have had an increased heart rate at times but have measured my pulse but it has not gone over 92/minute. I have minor headache and anxiety as the drug is wearing off. Do you think I should continue to use Adderall? What dosage?

Man is both mind and body. How can we imagine health without considering one's mind and body together? Similarly how can we say that mind is not important in sickness. You gave a lot of information about investigations but what about your mind?As a Homoeopath, I can presume that you had a psychological conflict, something that you could not \\\"digest\\\", just before the development of the complaints in your abdomen. You kept it in your mind without resolving in the psychological level. There are centres in the brain corresponding to every emotion and every organ. The mind- brain- organ axis makes the disease; the location and type of disease is decided by one's MIASM.In your case, the liver is affected. The tendency to develop tumours is in your genetics. It started with small cyst, now developed to larger haemangioma. Your gastro enterologist can do nothing except cutting the tumour. Haemangioma is not a safe organ to be meddled with surgical interference. Since they have dropped the ball, I can take it up again, because we never treat your haemangioma, cyst or abdomen. We treat YOU and YOU only.We pay more importance to your genetic disposition to develop tumour, of course. But your life situations, your mental and physical reactions, your particular  psychological conflicts that precipitated the disease, your past history, family history, mental and physical make ups etc are most important while taking your case. A rightly chosen genetic constitutional remedy will cure your haemangioma without any surgery. Please do not imagine that cure is its total disappearance or that you will become healthy only by removing it. Understand that your body has innumerable defence mechanisms and even now you are 'almost' compromised with the tumour. The balance of uncompromising is manifested through your present pains and other discomforts. You have to get your psychological conflicts resolved in the psychological level itself. After taking the Homoeopathic remedy, once you stop getting pains and other discomforts, understand that you have started improving. Wait for days when your body will keep the haemangioma to a stage from where it started coming up. Let is take time. But you can ignore about it under Homoeopathic treatment. No need of any removal. Rather, I would advise you never go for any surgery.Either you can approach a very expert Homoeopathic physician or you can approach me by asking a direct premium question through Healthcare magic. I will then send to you a case taking format in which you will develop YOUR whole history and send it back to me. Then I will suggest your Miasmatic / genetic constitutional remedy which will cure YOU. With Best Wishes,Dr. C. J.

The first symptom before she got the fever was high stomach ache. This was followed by sever loose motion and then vomiting followed by high temperature.

She was normal for two months after the surgery and during August 2010, she was complaining again about stomach pain. The doctors confirmed again that everything is ok. But even then she used to complain about the pain. The pain became worse during Nov 2010 and we did all the Ultra Sound scanning again and the reports seemed to be normal. We had visited the surgeon who had operated her and instead him to do a thorough check and he had said that she had got a severe constipation problem which we need to look into and it has to controlled through our food and he said he had given a medicine of low dosage (duphalac) which we need to continue for 3 months. Last week we have observed her bringing the water bottle as is from her school. This means she didn t drink water. On investigations we have found that for many days she had not even passed urine in the school. We have found out that she is not drinking enough water. Though we already know that she had a constipation issue, we don\u2019t want her to face the urinary infection related issue and hence we have completely changed her intake habits in the last four five days by including more fibrous food in her diets and also included 1 banana during her dinner and evening snacks. Also ensure that she drinks atleast 1.2-1.4 Liters of water daily. We have seen a remarkable change in the last two three days after implementing the above changes. But still we are seeing that she is facing difficulty while passing her stools. I mean she is passing it in a very low/medium quantity. We still feel that she is not passing her stools completely. She is complaining about her stomach pain only during passing the stools. This is the entire case history of my daughter s stomach ache problem. Now my questions are as follows: a) How to improve the quantity of her stools without increasing her food? How to ensure that she passes the stools completely? Is there anything else to be followed? b) It seems that we have identified her problem. Now we need to understand how to cure it. Kindly let me know if our analysis is right? Is she got the stomach pain due to constipation? Or could there be any other problems - Kindly advice. c) If it is due to constipation - Then how do we cure this constipation problem? Will taking 15 ml of duphalac daily during the night after dinner for the next three months cure constipation? Or is there any other way for curing it earlier? Once if it is cured is there any chances that it can recur again? How to avoid it in the future? d) What are all the other causes of stomach pain?
